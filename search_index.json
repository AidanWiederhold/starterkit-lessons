For\nsome of the steps the solution requires waiting for a day or so.\nSo please try them before arriving and try to fix what ever does\nnot work.\n\nFollow this guide before arriving; we will not have time to help\nyou with problems on these issues during the workshop. This means\nyou will end up watching instead of participating.\n\nThis will be an interactive workshop, so you will need to bring\na computer. There will be no machines for you to use in the room.\n\nFollow all the steps using the computer you plan to bring, not\nyour desktop or someone else's computer.\n\nIf this is the first time you are bringing your laptop to CERN, you\nwill have to register it before it can\naccess the internet.

In fact, if we were to store all the data coming in to LHCb, we would be recording ~ 1 TB every second.\nThat's too much data for us to be able to keep all of it, the price of storage \nis just too high, so instead we need to filter the data and try to keep only \nthe events which contain something interesting.\nThis raises its own problems:\n\nHow do we filter and process the recorded data quickly and accurately?\nHow do we manage all the complex tasks required to work with collision data?\nHow do we organize all the data of a single bunch crossing in a flexible way?\nHow do we configure our software flexibly without having to recompile it?\nCan you think of more?\n\nThese questions arise mostly due to two key points: the data must be processed \nvery quickly because it's arriving very quickly, and the data is complex so \nthere's a lot that can be done with it.\nCollisions recorded by the LHCb detector go through a specific data flow \ndesigned to maximise the data-taking efficiency and data quality.\nThis consists of several steps, each one being controlled by an ‘application’ \nthat processes the data event-by-event, using the data from the previous step \nand creating the results ready for the next.\nThese steps are as follows:\n\nData from the detector are filtered through the trigger, which consists \nof the L0, implemented in hardware, and the high level trigger (HLT), \nimplemented in software. The application responsible for the software trigger \nis Moore, discussed in the trigger lesson \nin second-analysis-steps.\nTriggered, raw data are reconstructed to transform the detector hits into \nobjects such as tracks and clusters. This is done by the Brunel \napplication. The objects are stored into an output file in a ‘DST’ format.\nThe reconstructed DST files are suitable for analysis, but they are not \naccessible to users due to computing restrictions. Data are filtered \nfurther through a set of selections called the stripping, controlled by \nthe DaVinci application which write out data either in the DST or ‘µDST’ \n(micro-DST) format. To save disk space and to speed up access for analysts, the \noutput files are grouped into streams which contain similar selections.\nBy grouping all of the fully hadronic charm selections together, for \nexample, analysts interested in that type of physics don't waste time running \nover the output of the dimuon selections.\n The output formatA DST file is a ROOT file which contains the full event information, such as \nreconstructed objects and raw data. Each event typically takes around 150kB of \ndisk space in the DST format.\nThe µDST format was designed to save space by storing only the \ninformation concerning the build candidates (that is, the objects used \nto construct particle decays like tracks); the raw event, which takes \naround 50kB per event, is discarded.\n \n\nUsers can run their own analysis tools to extract variables for their \nanalysis with the DaVinci application. The processing is slightly different \nbetween DST and µDST, since some calculations need the other tracks in the \nevent (not only the signal), which are not available in the latter format.\n\n\nWe also produced lots of simulated events, often called Monte Carlo data, and \nthis is processed in a very similar way to real data.\nThis similarity is very beneficial, as the simulated data is subject to the \nsame deficiencies as in the processing of real data.\nThere are two simulation steps which replace the proton-proton collisions and \nthe detector response:\n\nThe simulation of proton-proton collisions, and the hadronisation and decay \nof the resulting particles, are ultimately controlled by the Gauss \napplication. Gauss is responsible for calling the various Monte Carlo \ngenerators that are supported such as Pythia (the default in LHCb) and POWHEG, \nand for controlling EvtGen and Geant4. EvtGen is used to describe the decays of \nsimulated particles, whilst Geant4 is used to simulate the propagation and \ninteraction of particles through and with the detector.\nThe simulated hits made in the virtual detector are converted to signals \nthat mimic the real detector by the Boole application. The output of Boole \nis designed to closely match the output of the real detector, and so the \nsimulated data can then be passed through the usual data processing chain \ndescribed above, beginning with the trigger.\n\nSo, the data flow and the associated applications look like this:\n\nKnowing this flow is essential in selecting your data! Different application \nversions can produce very different physics, so it's very useful to know how \neach application has manipulated the data you want to use.\n Why are there multiple applications?It's often simpler to create and visualise a single, monolithic program that \ndoes everything, but that's not how the data flow is set up in LHCb. Why not? \nWhat are the advantages of splitting up the software per task? What are the \ndisadvantages?\n \nWith the exception of a few specific studies, it is only the DaVinci \napplication that is run by users, everything else is run ‘centrally’ either on \nthe computing farm next to the detector or on the Grid.\nThe reconstruction, Brunel, is rarely performed as it is very computationally \nintensive.\nIt is only done when the data are taken and when a new reconstruction \nconfiguration is available.\nThe stripping can be performed more often, since it runs on reconstructed data.  \nStripping ‘campaigns’, when the stripping selections are centrally run, are \nidentified by a version as SXrYpZ:\n\nThe digit X marks the major stripping version. This marks all major \nrestrippings, in which the full list of selections are processed.\nThe digit Y is the release version, which was used during Run 1 to mark \nthe data type, which corresponds to the year the data were taken: 0 was \nused for 2012 and 1 for 2011. The latest stripping for Run 1 data is called \nS21 for 2012 and S21r1 for 2011.\nThe digit Z marks the patch version, which correspond to incremental \nstrippings; campaigns in which only a handful of selections are run, either \nto fix bugs or to add a small number of new ones.\n\nKnowing the reconstruction and stripping versions is often the most important \npart in choosing your data, because the selections generally always change \nbetween major stripping versions, and variables can look very different between \nreconstruction versions.\nThe list of stripping selection largely defines the reconstructed decays that \nare available to you, but the list is very long as there's a lot we can do with \nour data. If you don't know the stripping line you need, it's usually best to \nask the stripping coordinators of the working group you'll be presenting your \nwork to. To learn more about the stripping, the best resource is the stripping \npage on the LHCb\nTWiki.\nIn it we can find:\n\nThe status of the current stripping, e.g. for Stripping \nS28.\nThe configuration of all past stripping campaign, e.g. for Stripping \nS21r1.\n\nAdditionally, the information on all strippings can be found in the stripping \nproject \nwebsite, \nwhere you can see all the algorithms run and cuts applied in each line.\nFor example, if we wanted to understand the \nD2hhPromptDst2D2KKLine line, which we will use in the \nexploring a DST lesson later on, we would go \nhere.\n"},"first-analysis-steps/run-2-data-flow.html":{"url":"first-analysis-steps/run-2-data-flow.html","title":"Changes to the data flow in Run 2","keywords":"","body":"Changes to the data flow in Run 2\n Learning Objectives\nUnderstand how the LHCb data flow differs between Run 1 and Run 2\n\n \nRun 1 of the LHC ran from 2010 to the end of 2012. Run 2 began in the middle of \n2015 and is scheduled to continue until 2019.\nDuring Run 1 the LHC provided proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass \nenergy of 7 and 8 TeV, and in Run 2 the energy increases to 13 TeV.\nWith an increase in energy comes an increase in production cross-sections, and \nso a much higher rate of interesting events.\nSo now we have many more events that we would like to store, but as ever \nwe're limited by computing resources.\nTo help overcome this, LHCb introduced the Turbo stream in 2015, whereby the \nselection of candidates made in the second stage of the high level trigger, \nHLT2, is saved to disk and used directly by analysts, with no further offline \nreconstruction by Brunel.\nOmitting the offline reconstruction is usually a Bad Idea because it's usually \nof a much better quality than the reconstruction performed in the HLT (the \n‘online reconstruction’) as there's more time to run it. But, thanks to an \nenormous effort improving the reconstruction software both online and offline \nin between Run 1 and Run 2, the two reconstructions now perform identically.\nThis means if HLT2 performs all the reconstruction you need in your analysis, \nthere's no need to wait for the offline reconstruction to run!\nThis saves a lot of time (it's Turbo, after all), and hence money.\nThis saves time and money, but you still have many more events to save. To \novercome this, events saved to the Turbo stream contain only the candidates \nthat were reconstructed in the trigger. That is to say, any tracks or detector \nresponses that don't form part of the decay that the trigger line uses to \nevaluate its selection is thrown away.\nThis is quite pragmatic, because a lot of analyses don't use this information \nanyway.\nThe Turbo stream runs in parallel with the regular data flow, and so everything \nnow looks like this:\n\nThe change here is the addition of the Turbo stream in the storage output of \nthe trigger.\nThis stream cannot be re-reconstructed because the information needed to do \nthat is thrown away to save disk space.\nFor the topics covered in this course, though, this doesn't change things much because we can run \nDaVinci over the Turbo stream in exactly the same manner as for the stripping \noutput. We will just need to look in a different place to find the selection \ndefinitions, this time for trigger lines rather than stripping lines.\nIt's best to ask the trigger coordinator in your working group if your analysis \nhas a trigger line that outputs to the Turbo stream, and if so where to find \nthe selection definitions.\n"},"first-analysis-steps/davinci.html":{"url":"first-analysis-steps/davinci.html","title":"An introduction to LHCb Software","keywords":"","body":"An introduction to LHCb Software\n Learning Objectives\nLearn the key concepts needed to work with the LHCb software\nLearn how to launch the LHCb software with lb-run\n\n \nImagine you want to design and run a new particle detector.\nApart from organizing a collaboration, creating the design and specification, and several other tasks, you will also have to find solutions to many computational challenges.\nIt's worth thinking about these for a second:\n\nHow do we collect data as it is recorded by the detector?\nHow do we filter and process the recorded data efficiently?\nHow do we manage all the complex tasks required to work with collision data?\nHow do we organize all the data of a single bunch crossing in a flexible way?\nHow do we configure our software flexibly without having to recompile it?\nCan you think of more?\n\nHow would you go about solving these?\nThe decisions you make will affect the performance of your experiment during datataking and analysis.\nAt LHCb, we base our software on the Gaudi framework, which was specifically designed with the above questions in mind.\nIt's worth getting an idea of some of the most important Gaudi concepts at this point.\nAfter this, we will jump right into running the software and getting useful things done.\nEvent Loop\nBecause the individual bunch crossings (events) are almost completely independent of each other, it makes sense to process them one by one, without holding them all in memory at once.\nGaudi provides a global EventLoop, which allows you to process events one by one.\nTransient Event Store\nA single event contains lots of different data objects (Particles, Vertices, Tracks, Hits, ...).\nIn Gaudi, these are organized in the Transient Event Store (TES).\nYou can think of it as a per-event file system with locations like /Event/Rec/Track/Best or /Event/Phys/MyParticles.\nWhen running over the event stream, Gaudi allows you to get and put from/to these locations.\nThe contents of the TES are emptied at the end of the processing of each event.\nAlgorithms\nAn Algorithm is a C++ class that can be inserted into the EventLoop.\nThese allow you to perform a certain function for each event (like filtering according to trigger decision, reconstructing particles, ...).\nTools\nOften, algorithms will want to make use of some common function (vertex fitting, calculating distances, associating a primary vertex, ...).\nThese are implemented as Tools, which are shared between Algorithms.\nOptions\nTo make all of this configurable, Gaudi allows you to set properties of Algorithms and Tools from a Python script, called an option file.\nIn an option file, you can specify which Algorithms are run in which order, and set their properties (strings, integers, doubles, and lists and dicts of these things can be set).\nYou can then start the Gaudi EventLoop using this option file, and it will set up and run the corresponding C++ objects with specified settings.\nYou can find comprehensive documentation in the Gaudi Doxygen or the Gaudi Manual.\nUsually, you will work with one of the LHCb software projects that are based on Gaudi.\nOne of the most important ones is DaVinci, which provides lots of Algorithms and Tools for physics analysis.\nYou can run DaVinci using the following command on lxplus:\nlb-run DaVinci/v42r6p1 gaudirun.py\n\nThis will run the gaudirun.py command using version v42r6p1 of DaVinci.

To navigate to the simulation, expand the folder icon in the\n\"Bookkeeping tree\" window. Navigate to the MC/2016 folder.

(Not all simulated \nsamples have the same requirements made on the signal decay.)\nIf you expand the 27163002 (Dst_D0pi,KK=DecProdCut) folder you\nwill find a couple different subfolders to choose from. The names of these \nsubfolders correspond to different data-taking conditions, such as magnet \npolarity (MagDown and MagUp), as well as different software versions used \nto create the samples that are available. We will use \nBeam6500GeV-2016-MagDown-Nu1.6-25ns-Pythia8.\n So much choice!Often there are only one or two combinations of data-taking conditions and \nsoftware versions to choose from, but sometimes there can be very many.\nGenerally newer versions are the best bet, but you should always ask the \nMonte Carlo liason of your working group for advice on what to use if you're \nnot sure.\n\nNext we need to choose what version of the simulation you want to\nuse. There is only one available in our case, Sim09b, but usually the latest available version is best when there are more than one.\nWe also have to choose the version of the\ndigitisation and what configuration of the trigger (Trig0x6138160F in our case) and reconstruction\nwe want to have in the simulated sample. Usually\nthere is only one choice for these, which makes choosing easier.\nWe also have to select a version of the stripping. Choose any as long as it \ncontains the word Flagged.\n Flagged and filtered samplesIn the usual data-taking flow, the trigger and stripping are run in \nfiltering mode, whereby events that don't pass any trigger line or any \nstripping line are thrown away. In the simulation, it's often useful to keep \nsuch events so that the properties of the rejected events can be studied.\nThe trigger and stripping are then run in flagging mode, such that the \ndecisions are only recorded for later inspection.\nFiltered Monte Carlo can be produced for analyses that need lots of events.\n\nAfter all this, you will be presented with a ALLSTREAMS.DST entry.

Each of \nthe files contains a number of individual events, so if we just want to take a \nquick look at the dataset, it is sufficient to just obtain one of those files.\nBefore we can download the file, we need to set up our connection with the grid and load the Dirac software:\nlhcb-proxy-init\n\nInitialisation of the proxy might take a while and should ask you for your certificate password.\nOnce we have a working Dirac installation, getting the file is as easy as\nlb-run LHCbDIRAC dirac-dms-get-file LFN:/lhcb/MC/2016/ALLSTREAMS.DST/00062514/0000/00062514_00000001_7.AllStreams.dst\n\nAgain this will take a while but afterwards you should have a file called 00062514_00000001_7.AllStreams.dst in the directory where you called the command.\n Downloading the file during a Starterkit lessonLots of people downloading the same file at the same time can be very slow.\nAs a workaround, the file is also available on EOS, and can be downloaded to\nyour current directory with the following command:\n$ xrdcp root://eoslhcb.cern.ch//eos/lhcb/user/m/mwilkins/Starterkit/00062514_00000001_7.AllStreams.dst .\n\n \nSince these files tend to be quite large, you might want to use your AFS work \ndirectory instead of your AFS user directory to store files.\n Alternative: read files remotely instead of downloading themTo avoid filling up your AFS quota with DST files, you can also pass Gaudi an \nXML catalog such that it can access them remotely.\nFirst generate the XML catalog with\nlb-run LHCbDIRAC dirac-bookkeeping-genXMLCatalog --Options=MC_2016_27163002_Beam6500GeV2016MagDownNu1.625nsPythia8_Sim09b_Trig0x6138160F_Reco16_Turbo03_Stripping28NoPrescalingFlagged_ALLSTREAMS.DST.py --Catalog=myCatalog.xml\n\nand add\nfrom Gaudi.Configuration import FileCatalog\nFileCatalog().Catalogs = [ \"xmlcatalog_file:/path/to/myCatalog.xml\" ]\n\nto your options file.

However you can also explore\nthem interactively from a python session.\nThis is particularly useful if you want to quickly find\nsomething out, or the more complex processing in DaVinci\nis not working as expected.\nThe file we downloaded from the grid\ncontains simulated data, with stripping and trigger decisions\nand so on. Here we assumed the file you downloaded is called 00062514_00000001_7.AllStreams.dst.\nTo take a look at the contents of the TES, we need to write a small\nPython file:\nimport sys\n\nimport GaudiPython as GP\nfrom GaudiConf import IOHelper\nfrom Configurables import DaVinci\n\ndv = DaVinci()\ndv.DataType = '2016'\n\n# Pass file to open as first command line argument\ninputFiles = [sys.argv[-1]]\nIOHelper('ROOT').inputFiles(inputFiles)\n\nappMgr = GP.AppMgr()\nevt = appMgr.evtsvc()\n\nappMgr.run(1)\nevt.dump()\n\nPlace this into a file called first.py and run the following\ncommand in a new terminal:\n$ lb-run DaVinci/v42r6p1 ipython -i first.py 00062514_00000001_7.AllStreams.dst\n\nThis will open the DST and print out some of the TES locations\nwhich exist for this event. We are now ready to explore the TES,\nwhich is accessible via the evt variable. For example you could\nlook at the properties of some tracks for the first event by typing\ninside the python session:\ntracks = evt['/Event/Rec/Track/Best']\nprint tracks[0]\n\nThe next question is, how do you know what TES locations that could\nexist? As we saw evt.dump() prints a few of them, but not all. In\naddition there are some special ones that only exist if you try to\naccess them. The following snippet allows you to discover most TES\nlocations that are interesting:\ndef nodes(evt, node=None):\n    \"\"\"List all nodes in `evt`\"\"\"\n    nodenames = []\n\n    if node is None:\n        root = evt.retrieveObject('')\n        node = root.registry()\n\n    if node.object():\n        nodenames.append(node.identifier())\n        for l in evt.leaves(node):\n            # skip a location that takes forever to load\n            # XXX How to detect these automatically??\n            if 'Swum' in l.identifier():\n                continue\n\n            temp = evt[l.identifier()]\n            nodenames += nodes(evt, l)\n\n    else:\n        nodenames.append(node.identifier())\n\n    return nodenames\n\nThe easiest way to use it is to add it to your first.py script\nand re-run it as before. Then, in your iPython session, enter nodes(evt).\nThis will list a large number of TES locations, but even so there\nare some which you have to know about. Another oddity is that some\nlocations are \"packed\", for example: /Event/AllStreams/pPhys/Particles.\nYou can not access these directly at this location. Instead you\nhave to know what location the contents will get unpacked to when\nyou want to use it. Often you can just try removing the small p\nfrom the location (/Event/AllStreams/Phys/Particles).\nYou can also inspect the particles and vertices built by your stripping\nline. However not every event will contain a candidate for your line,\nso the first tool we need is something that will advance us until\nthe stripping decision was positive:\ndef advance(decision):\n    \"\"\"Advance until stripping decision is true, returns\n    number of events by which we advanced\"\"\"\n    n = 0\n    while True:\n        appMgr.run(1)\n\n        if not evt['/Event/Rec/Header']:\n            print 'Reached end of input files'\n            break\n\n        n += 1\n        dec=evt['/Event/Strip/Phys/DecReports']\n        if dec.hasDecisionName('Stripping{0}Decision'.format(decision)):\n            break\n\n    return n\n\nAdd this to your script and restart ipython as before.\n Detecting file endsIt is not easy to detect that the input file has ended. Especially\nif you want to get it right for data and simulation. Checking that\n/Event/Rec/Header exists is a safe bet in simulation and data if\nyour file has been processed by Brunel (the event reconstruction\nsoftware). It might not work in other cases.\n \nUsing the name of our stripping line we can now advance through the\nDST until we reach an event which contains a candidate:\nline = 'D2hhPromptDst2D2KKLine'\nadvance(line)\n\nThe candidates built for you can now be found at /Event/AllStreams/Phys/D2hhPromptDst2D2KKLine/Particles:\ncands = evt['/Event/AllStreams/Phys/{0}/Particles'.format(line)]\nprint cands.size()\n\nThis tells you how many candidates there are in this event and you can access the first\none with:\nprint cands[0]\n\nWhich will print out some information about the Particle. In our case a $$D^{* -}$$ (particle ID number -413). You can access its daughters with\ncands[0].daughtersVector()[0] and cands[0].daughtersVector()[1],\nwhich will be a $$\\overline{D^{0}}$$ and a $$\\pi^{-}$$.\nThere is a useful tool for printing out decay trees, which you can\npass the top level particle to and it will print out the daughters etc:\nprint_decay = appMgr.toolsvc().create(\n  'PrintDecayTreeTool', interface='IPrintDecayTreeTool'\n)\nprint_decay.printTree(cands[0])\n\nWith our candidates in hand, it would be nice to be able to retrieve and\ncompute the variables we need for an analysis. On to LoKi\nfunctors!\n Fast DST browsingWhile here we have discussed for pedagogical reasons all the configuration\noptions needed in order to browse a DST file, in your daily life as a\nphysicist it is often useful to use the bender application that belongs to\nthe Bender project.\nFor example, to explore the DST we could have simply done:\nlb-run Bender/latest bender 00062514_00000001_7.AllStreams.dst\nThis leaves us in a prompt in which we can proceed as discussed in this\nlesson, with the advantage that some functions are already provided\nfor us, such as seekStripDecision (which replaces our advance) or\nls and get, which allow to list and get TES locations.\nOther examples of useful functions are listed in the bender starting\nbanner.\nBender also provides a useful command dst-dump, which is a quick way of\nfiguring out what objects are present on a DST and where. Try out:\nlb-run Bender/latest dst-dump -f -n 100 00062514_00000001_7.AllStreams.dst\nThe -f option tells Bender to try and \"unpack\" the locations such as\n/Event/AllStreams/pPhys/Particles that we mentioned above, while -n 100\ntells it to only process the first 100 events on the DST.\nGive this a try if you're ever stuck figuring out where your candidates are hiding!\n \n"},"first-analysis-steps/loki-functors.html":{"url":"first-analysis-steps/loki-functors.html","title":"Fun with LoKi Functors","keywords":"","body":"Fun with LoKi Functors\n Learning Objectives\nFind out how the physics information can be obtained from the DST\nUnderstand what LoKi functors are\nUse LoKi functors interactively\nBe able to find functors that do what we want\n\n \nLoKi functors are designed to flexibly compute and compare properties of the \ncurrent decay, from simple quantities such as the transverse momentum of a \nparticle to complicated ones like helicity angles.\nInternally, functors are implemented as C++ classes that take an object of type TYPE1 and return another of TYPE2.\nThey can be used both in C++ and in Python code, and can be combined with each other using logical operations.\nAccording to TYPE2 there are 3 types of functors:\n\nFunctions, which return double.\nPredicates, which return a bool.\nStreamers, which return a std::vector of some other type TYPE3.\n\nWhen filling tuples, the most used functors are functions, while predicates are typically used for selections.\nAccording to TYPE1, there are many types of functors, the most important of which are (you can find a full list in the LoKi FAQ):\n\nParticle functors, which take LHCb::Particle* as input.\nVertex functors, which take LHCb::VertexBase* as input.\nMC particle functors, which take LHCb::MCParticle* as input.\nMC vertex functors, which take LHCb::MCVertex* as input.\nArray particle functors, which take a LoKi::Range_ (an array of particles) as input.\nTrack functors, which take LHCb::Track as input.\n\n C++ classesThings like LHCb::Particle are C++ classes that usually represent some \nphysical object. You will interact with the C++ objects directly very rarely, \nif ever.\n \nTo understand what we can do with LoKi functors, we will pick up from where we \nleft off exploring a DST interactively.\nOpen the DST and get the first candidate in the D2hhPromptDst2D2KKLine line:\ncands = evt['/Event/AllStreams/Phys/D2hhPromptDst2D2KKLine/Particles']\ncand = cands[0]\n\nWe can now try to get very simple properties of the $$D^{* -}$$ candidate. Let's start from the components of its momentum.\nThis can be done calling the function momentum() for our candidate in the following way:\np_x = cand.momentum().X()\np_y = cand.momentum().Y()\np_z = cand.momentum().Z()\nprint p_x, p_y, p_z\n\nThis is inconvenient when running DaVinci with Python options files: there's no way of calling the momentum() method.\nInstead, we can use the corresponding LoKi particle functors:\nfrom LoKiPhys.decorators import PX, PY, PZ\nprint PX(cand)\nprint PY(cand)\nprint PZ(cand)\n\nYou will see an error when loading the functors:\nLoKiSvc.REPORT      ERROR LoKi::AuxDesktopBase:     loadDesktop(): unable to load IPhysDesktop! StatusCode=FAILURE\nLoKiSvc.REPORT      ERROR The   ERROR message is suppressed : 'LoKi::AuxDesktopBase:     loadDesktop(): unable to load IPhysDesktop!' StatusCode=FAILURE\nThis is related to the fact that some functors need to run in the DaVinci \n‘scope’, and they are all loaded in the LoKiPhys.decorators module. It's \nharmless in the examples we will use.\nIf the import is made before the instantiation of the ApplicationMgr, there \nwill be no warnings.\n Does it make sense?Compare the output of PX functor with the result of calling the function cand.momentum().X(). \n \nMath operations are also allowed:\np_components_sum = PX + PY + PZ\np_components_sum(cand)\n\nThere exist specific LoKi functors for all the most important properties of the particle. For example, the transverse momentum and mass:\nfrom LoKiPhys.decorators import PT, M\nprint PT(cand)\nprint M(cand)\n\n Some practiceRetrieve the momentum magnitude using functors PX, PY and PZ. There is also a specific functor P which does the job. Compare the results. \nNow, retrieve the transverse momentum and invariant mass (you will probably need the energy functor E), and see if it matches what the PT and M functors return.\n \n A note about unitsBy the convention, the LHCb default units are MeV, millimeters and nanoseconds. It is easy to print the values of interest in other units:\nfrom LoKiPhys.decorators import GeV\nprint PT(cand)/GeV\n\n \nIf we want to get the properties of the $$D^{* -}$$ vertex, for example its fit \nquality ($$\\chi^2$$), we need to pass a vertex object to the vertex functor.\nfrom LoKiPhys.decorators import VCHI2\nprint VCHI2(cand.endVertex())\n\nAgain, this is inconvenient when running DaVinci with Python options \nfiles, since in that case we don't have any way of \ncalling the endVertex method.\nInstead, we can use the VFASPF adaptor functor, which allows us to use \nvertex functors as if they were particle functors (note how the functor is \nbuilt by combining two functors).\nfrom LoKiPhys.decorators import VFASPF\nVCHI2(cand.endVertex()) == VFASPF(VCHI2)(cand)\n\n Functions of functions of functions of…Make sure you understand what VFASPF(VCHI2)(cand) means. It may help to play \naround in Python, creating a function that takes another function as an \nargument, for example:\ndef create_greeting(salutation):\n    def greet(name):\n        print '{0}, {1}!'.format(salutation, name)\n    return greet\n\nWhat would create_greeting('Hello') return? What about \ncreate_greeting('Howdy')('partner')? Why is doing this useful?\n \nCalculation of some of the properties, such as the impact parameter (IP) or cosine of the \ndirection angle (DIRA), requires the knowledge of the primary vertex (PV) \nassociated to the candidate.\nIn GaudiPython, we can get the PVs ourselves.\npv_finder_tool = appMgr.toolsvc().create(\n    'GenericParticle2PVRelator/P2PVWithIPChi2',\n    interface='IRelatedPVFinder'\n)\npvs = evt['/Event/Rec/Vertex/Primary']\nbest_pv = pv_finder_tool.relatedPV(cand, pvs)\n\nNow, we can get the cosine of the direction angle for the candidate given the primary vertex: \nfrom LoKiPhys.decorators import DIRA\nprint DIRA(best_pv)(cand)\n\nGiven that this is a very common operation, we have the possibility of using, in the context of a DaVinci application (Stripping, for example), a special set of functors, starting with the BPV prefix (for Best PV), which will get the PV for us.\nSome functors also end with the suffix DV, which means they can only be used in the DaVinci context.\nTo get the quality of impact parameter of the candidate, one needs as well to call a distance calculator:\nfrom GaudiPython.Bindings import AppMgr, gbl \ngaudi = AppMgr() \ndistCal = gaudi.toolSvc().create(\"LoKi::DistanceCalculator\", interface=gbl.IDistanceCalculator) \nipTool = gbl.LoKi.Vertices.ImpactParamTool(distCal)\n\nNow, we evaluate the quality of impact parameter of the candidate, given the primary vertex, and using the provided calculator:\nfrom LoKiPhys.decorators import IPCHI2\nprint IPCHI2(best_pv, ipTool)(cand)\n\nIn the context of DaVinci application, e.g. the Stripping, the things become much simplier since the calculator instances are loaded automatically, and the syntax for calling the IPCHI2 functor becomes IPCHI2(best_pv,geo())(cand), where geo() is the geometry calculator tool.\n Finding LoKi functorsThe full list of defined LoKi functors can be found in the LoKi::Cuts \nnamespace in the \ndoxygen.\nThey are quite well documented with examples on how to use them.\nThe list can be overwhelming, so it's also worth checking a more curated selection of functors in the TWiki, here and here.\n \nSo far we've only looked at the properties of the head of the decay (that is, \nthe $$D^{* -}$$), but what if we want to get information about its daughters? As \nan example, let's get the largest transverse momentum of the final state \nparticles.\nA simple solution would be to navigate the tree and calculate the maximum \n$$p_{\\text{T}}$$.\ndef find_tracks(particle):\n    tracks = []\n    if particle.isBasicParticle():\n        proto = particle.proto()\n        if proto:\n            track = proto.track()\n            if track:\n                try:\n                    tracks.append(particle.data())\n                except AttributeError:\n                    tracks.append(particle)\n    else:\n        for child in particle.daughters():\n            tracks.extend(find_tracks(child))\n    return tracks\n\nmax_pt = max([PT(child) for child in find_tracks(cand)])\n\n A note about the try/exceptIf you import LoKi before running this example, it magically removes the \n.data() function and allows the particle to be used directly. The code above \nis made general using the try/except block and will work in either case.\n \nHowever, LoKi offers functions for performing such operations, namely MAXTREE and MINTREE, which get as parameters the selection criteria, the functor to calculate and a default value.\nIn our example,\nfrom LoKiPhys.decorators import MAXTREE, ISBASIC, HASTRACK\nMAXTREE(ISBASIC & HASTRACK, PT, -1)(cand) == max_pt\n\nIn this example, we have used two selection functors, ISBASIC and HASTRACK, which return true if the particle doesn't have children and is made up by a track, respectively.\nWe can see that they do the same thing as particle.isBasicParticle() and particle.proto().track() in a more compact way.\n Combining LoKi cutsYou might have noticed above we used the & operator (\"bitwise AND\") to \ncombine the ISBASIC and HASTRACK cuts above.\nThis is because Python doesn't allow LoKi to override the behaviour of and and or (\"logical AND/OR\"), so if we use them\nthe Python interpreter tries to combine the two cuts straight away, before we have even passed in our candidate:\nIn [1]: ((M>1200) or (PT > 500))\nOut[1]:  (M>1200)\n\nthe result is that our PT cut vanishes!\nIf we use the | operator (\"bitwise OR\") then LoKi correctly builds a functor representing the OR of our cuts:\nIn [2]: ((M>1200) | (PT > 500))\nOut[2]:  ( (M>1200) || (PT>500) )\n\nThis is why you should always use & and | when combining LoKi functors, and never use and and or.\n \nSimilarly, the SUMTREE functor allows us to accumulate quantities for those children that pass a certain selection:\nfrom LoKiPhys.decorators import SUMTREE, ABSID\nprint SUMTREE(321 == ABSID, PT)(cand)\nprint SUMTREE('K+' == ABSID, PT)(cand)\n\nIn this case, we have summed the transverse momentum of the charged kaons in the tree.\nNote the usage of the ABSID functor, which selects particles from the decay \ntree using either their PDG Monte Carlo \nID or their name.\nIf you would like to consider only the kaons of one specific charge in the selection requirement, consider the ID functor which does exactly the same thing, however has a sign which is positive for particles and negative for antiparticles. \nAnother very useful LoKi functor is CHILD, which allows us to access a \nproperty of a single child of the particle.\nTo specify which child we want, its order is used, so we need to know how the candidate was built.\nFor example, from\nIn [10]: cand.daughtersVector()\nOut[10]:\n\n0 |->D~0                          M/PT/E/PX/PY/PZ: 1.8643/ 2.841 / 34.29/ 1.288/ 2.532/ 34.12 [GeV]  #  1 \n                                     EndVertex  X/Y/Z: 1.042/0.2034/-112.2 [mm]  Chi2/nDoF 0.007451/1 #  1 \n1    |->K-                        M/PT/E/PX/PY/PZ: 0.4937/ 2.2054/ 19.37/ 1.481/ 1.634/ 19.23 [GeV]  #  8 \n1    |->K+                        M/PT/E/PX/PY/PZ: 0.4937/ 0.9181/ 14.92/-0.1928/0.8977/ 14.89 [GeV]  #  7 \n0 |->pi-                          M/PT/E/PX/PY/PZ: 0.1396/ 0.1808/ 2.544/0.1047/0.1474/ 2.534 [GeV]  #  1\n\nwe know that D~0 is the first child and pi- is the second.\nTherefore, to access the mass of the $$D^{0}$$ we have 2 options:\nfrom LoKiPhys.decorators import CHILD\n# Option 1\nmass = M(cand.daughtersVector()[0])\n# Option 2\nmass_child = CHILD(M, 1)(cand)\n# Do they agree?\nmass == mass_child\n\n Child vertex?Evaluate the quality of the \n \nIn the similar way, we may access properties of child of the child: for example, a kaon from the $$D^{0}$$ decay:\nfrom LoKiPhys.decorators import CHILD\nmass_kaon = CHILD(CHILD(M, 1),1)(cand)\n\n Tracks and PIDFor the particles having tracks, we may exploit track functors to get the corresponding track properties. For instance, the track quality is given by functor TRCHI2.\nWhat happens if we call TRCHI2(cand)? Explain the result.\nEvaluate the track quality for the first and second kaon, also independently of that retrieve (in a single line) the worst of two.\nThen, evaluate the probability that each kaon is really a kaon (PROBNNk) or rather a misidentified pion (PROBNNpi).\n \nThe usage of LoKi functors extends much further than in the interactive \nGaudiPython world we've been exploring here.\nThey constitute the basis of particle filtering in the selection framework, \ndiscussed in the Building your own decay \nchain \nlesson in \nsecond-analysis-steps.\nSelecting particles means using LoKi predicates, functors that give a bool \noutput, like ISBASIC and HASTRACK.\nAmongst these, a key functor is in_range, which returns True if the value \nof the given function functor (that is, the functor that returns a double) \nis within the given lower and upper limit.\nIt helps writing CPU-efficient functors and thus is very important when building time-critical software like trigger or stripping lines.\nfrom LoKiCore.functions import in_range\nin_range(2000, M, 2014)(cand)\nin_range(1860, CHILD(M, 1), 1870)(cand)\n\n Understanding the cuts in the stripping linesHave a look at the stripping line \nD2hhPromptDst2D2KKLine which is used in our example. Open a CombineParticles/D2hhPromptDst2D2KKLine section, and explain which requirements are coded in the 'MotherCut', 'DaughterCuts' and 'CombinationCut' sections. \n(More details about CombineParticles algorithm are explained in the lesson of second analysis steps.)\n \nAdditionally, LoKi functors can be used directly inside our DaVinci jobs to store specific bits of information in our ntuples without the need for a complicated C++-based algorithms.\nThis second option will be discussed in the TupleTools and branches lesson.\n Debugging LoKi functorsIf you write complicated LoKi functors, typically in the context of selections, \nyou need functions for debugging when things go wrong.\nLoKi provides wrapper functors that evaluate a functor (or functor expression), print

locally\nLooping event-by-event over a file and inspecting\ninteresting quantities with LoKi functors is great for\nexploration: to checking that the file contains the candidates you need, that\nthe topology makes sense, and so on.\nIt's impractical for most cases, though, where you want all the candidates\nyour trigger/stripping line produced, which could be tens of millions of\ndecays.\nIn these cases we use DaVinci, the application for analysing high-level\ninformation such as tracks and vertices, which we'll look at in this lesson to\nproduce a ROOT ntuple.\n Learning Objectives\nRun a DaVinci job over a local DST\nInspect the ntuple output\nSet up the job to run in Ganga\n\n \nWith some stripped data located, it's useful to store the information on the\nselected particles inside an ntuple.\nThis allows for quick, local analysis with ROOT,\nrather than always searching through a DST that contains lots of things we're\nnot interested in.\nAs well as being the application that runs the stripping,\nDaVinci\nallows you to access events stored in DSTs and copy the information to ROOT\nntuples.\nYou tell DaVinci what you want it to do through options files, written in\nPython.\nThere are lots of things you can do with DaVinci options files, as there's lots\nof information available on the DST, but for now we'll just work on getting the\nbare essentials up and running.\nOur main tool will be the DecayTreeTuple object, which we'll create inside a\nfile we will call ntuple_options.py:\nfrom Configurables import DecayTreeTuple\nfrom DecayTreeTuple.Configuration import *\n\n# Stream and stripping line we want to use\nstream = 'AllStreams'\nline = 'D2hhPromptDst2D2KKLine'\n\n# Create an ntuple to capture D*+ decays from the StrippingLine line\ndtt = DecayTreeTuple('TupleDstToD0pi_D0ToKK')\ndtt.Inputs = ['/Event/{0}/Phys/{1}/Particles'.format(stream, line)]\ndtt.Decay = '[D*(2010)+ -> (D0 -> K- K+) pi+]CC'\n\nThis imports the DecayTreeTuple class, and then creates an object called\ndtt representing our ntuple.\nOnce DaVinci has run, the resulting ntuple will be saved in a folder within the\noutput ROOT file called TupleDstToD0pi_D0ToKpi.\nThe Inputs attribute specifies where DecayTreeTuple should look for\nparticles, and here we want it to look at the output of the stripping line\nwe're interested in.\nAs stripping lines can save many decays to a DST, the Decay attribute\nspecifies what decay we would like to have in our ntuple.\nIf there are no particles at the Input location, or the Decay string\ndoesn't match any particles at that location, the ntuple will not be filled.\n Decay descriptorsThere is a special syntax for the Decay attribute string, commonly called\n'decay descriptors', that allow a lot of flexibility with what you accept.\nFor example, D0 -> K- X+ will match any D0 decay that contains one\nnegatively charged kaon and one positively charged track of any species.\nMore information the decay descriptor syntax can be found on the LoKi decay\nfinders TWiki\npage.\n \nNow we need to tell DaVinci how to behave.\nThe DaVinci class allows you to tell DaVinci how many events to run over,\nwhat type of data is being used, what algorithms to run over the events, and so\non.\nThere are many configuration\nattributes\ndefined on the DaVinci object, but we will only set the ones that are\nnecessary for us.\nfrom Configurables import DaVinci\n\n# Configure DaVinci\nDaVinci().UserAlgorithms += [dtt]\nDaVinci().InputType = 'DST'\nDaVinci().TupleFile =

self-explanatory:\nInputType should be 'DST' when giving DaVinci DST files; PrintFreq\ndefines how often DaVinci should print its status; DataType is the year of\ndata-taking the data corresponds to, which we get from looking at the\nbookkeeping path used to get the input DST; Simulation should be True when\nusing Monte Carlo data, Lumi defines whether to store information on the\nintegrated luminosity the input data corresponds to; and EvtMax defines how\nmany events to run over, where a value of -1 means \"all events\".\nThe CondDBtag and DDDBtag attributes specify the exact detector conditions\nthat the Monte Carlo was generated with.\nSpecifying these tags is important, as without them you can end up with the\nwrong magnet polarity value in your ntuple, amongst other Bad Things.\nYou can find the values for these tags in the bookkeeping\nfile\nwe downloaded earlier.\n Database tagsGenerally, the CondDB and DDDB tags are different for each dataset you\nwant to use, but will be the same for all DSTs within a given dataset.\nWhen using simulated data, always find out what the database tags are for\nyour dataset!\nFor real collision data, you shouldn't specify these tags, as the default\ntags are the latest and greatest, so just remove those lines from the options\nfile.\n \nIn order to run an algorithm that we have previously created, we need to add it\nto the UserAlgorithms list.\nThe TupleFile attribute defines the name of the ROOT output file that DaVinci\nwill store any algorithm output in, which should be our ntuple.\nAll that's left to do is to say what data we would like to run over.\nAs we already have a data file downloaded locally, we\ndefine that as our input data.\nfrom GaudiConf import IOHelper\n\n# Use the local input data\nIOHelper().inputFiles([\n    './00062514_00000001_7.AllStreams.dst'\n], clear=True)\n\nThis says to use the .dst file that is in the same directory as the options\nfile, and to clear any previous input files that might have been defined.\nThat's it! We're ready to run DaVinci.\nIn the same folder as your options file ntuple_options.py and your DST file\nending in .dst, there's just a single command you need run on lxplus.\n$ lb-run DaVinci/v42r6p1 gaudirun.py ntuple_options.py\n\nThe full options file we've created, ntuple_options.py, is available\nhere.\nA slightly modified version that uses remote files (using an XML catalog as\ndescribed here) is available\nhere\n Using a microDSTA microDST (or µDST) is a smaller version of a DST.\nSome stripping lines go to µDSTs, and some go to DSTs.\nThere are two things that need changing in our options file in order to have\nit work when it is used with a stripping line that goes to a µDST:\n\nThe DecayTreeTuple.Inputs attribute should start at the word\nPhys; and\nThe RootInTES attribute on the DaVinci object has to be set to\n/Event/$STREAM\n\nIn context, the changes look like\ndtt.Inputs = ['Phys/{0}/Particles'.format(line)]\n# ...\nDaVinci().RootInTES = '/Event/{0}'.format(stream)\n\n \n"},"first-analysis-steps/davinci-grid.html":{"url":"first-analysis-steps/davinci-grid.html","title":"Running DaVinci on the grid","keywords":"","body":"Running DaVinci on the grid\n Learning Objectives\nCreate a ganga job\nSubmit a ganga job\nWaiting for ganga\nFind the job output\n\n \nThis lesson will teach you how to take our minimal DaVinci\njob and run it on the grid.\nganga is a program which you can use to interact with your grid\njobs.

Instead of specifying the\nfiles to process as part of the options file you have now to tell the\nJob about it. This allows ganga to split your job up,\nprocessing different files simultaneously.\n DaVinciDev folderWhen you create a job using prepareGaudiExec('DaVinci','v42r6p1', myPath='.')\nyou get the following message:\nINFO     Set up App Env at: ./DaVinciDev_v42r6p1\nganga has created a folder with a local copy of the DaVinci v42r6p1 release.\nThe content of it will be sent to the grid to ensure your jobs runs with \nexactly this configuration.\nWe will use this folder for the following jobs and you will learn more about\nthis in the Developing LHCb Software lesson.\n \nNow you have created your first job, however it has not started\nrunning yet. To submit it type j.submit(). Now ganga will do the\nequivalent of lb-run DaVinci/v42r6p1, prepare your job and then\nship it off to the grid.\nWhile it runs, let's submit an identical job via slightly different\nmethod. Having to type in the details of each job every time you want\nto run it is error prone and tedious. Instead you can place all the\nlines that define a job in a file and simply run that.\nPlace the following in a file called first-job.py:\nj = Job(name='First ganga job')\nmyApp = GaudiExec()\nmyApp.directory = \"./DaVinciDev_v42r6p1\"\nj.application = myApp\nj.application.options = ['code/davinci-grid/ntuple_options_grid.py']\nj.application.readInputData('data/MC_2016_27163002_Beam6500GeV2016MagDownNu1.625nsPythia8_Sim09b_Trig0x6138160F_Reco16_Turbo03_Stripping28NoPrescalingFlagged_ALLSTREAMS.DST.py')\nj.backend = Dirac()\nj.outputfiles = [LocalFile('DVntuple.root')]\nj.submit()\n\nWhich you can execute and submit like so, from within a ganga\nsession:\n%ganga first-job.py\n\nThis will print output similar to submitting the job from with in\nganga.\nYou can check on your jobs by typing jobs into a ganga\nconsole. This will list all of your jobs, their status, what kind of\napplication they are and more.\nYou can get more detailed information about your job by typing\njobs($jobid), replacing $jobid with the id of the job you are\ninterested in. For concretness we will assume you are interested in\na job with jobid 787 in this example.\nOnce your job has finished its status will be completed. Check this\nby typing jobs or by printing out the status of one particular job:\nprint 'Status of my job:', jobs(787).status\n\nThe next thing to do is to find the output of your job. Two things can\nhappen to files your job creates:\n\nThey get downloaded by ganga, or\nthey are stored \"on the grid\".\n\nBy default ganga will download most files below a size of XX MB. The\nrest will remain on the grid. Log files will almost always be downloaded.\nTo find where the files ganga downloaded are you can check the outputdir\nproperty of your job.\noutput = jobs(787).outputdir\nprint 'Job output stored in:', output\n\nTake a look at the contents of this directory.\n Using the Shell from IPythonIPython lets you execute shell commands from within the ganga session.\nThis means you can list the contents of a directory without leaving ganga\nby typing !ls /tmp/. This will list the contents of the /tmp directory.\nIn our case we can use this to list the contents of the job output directory\nwith !ls $output as we stored the path in the variable output.\n \nTo look at the root file produced by the job start a new terminal, and\ntype:\n$ lb-run DaVinci/v42r6p1 $SHELL\n$ root -l path/to/the/job/output\n\nYou need to setup DaVinci as we need ROOT version 6 to read the nTuple.\n Getting help with gangaTo find out more take a look at the Ganga \nFAQ\n \n"},"first-analysis-steps/add-tupletools.html":{"url":"first-analysis-steps/add-tupletools.html","title":"TupleTools and branches","keywords":"","body":"TupleTools and branches\n Learning Objectives\nAdd extra TupleTools to the default DecayTreeTuple\nConfigure the extra TupleTools\nUse branches\nFind useful TupleTools\nLearn how to use LoKi functors in a DecayTreeTuple\n\n \nUsually, the default information stored by DecayTreeTuple as shown in our minimal DaVinci job is not enough for physics analysis.\nFortunately, most of the information we need can be added by adding C++ tools (known as TupleTools) to dtt;\nthere is an extensive library of these, some of which will be briefly discussed during the lesson.\n Default DecayTreeTuple toolsThe default tools added in DecayTreeTuple are:\n\nTupleToolKinematic, which fills the kinematic information of the decay.\nTupleToolPid, which stores DLL and PID information of the particle.\nTupleToolANNPID, which stores the new NeuralNet-based PID information of the particle.\nTupleToolGeometry, which stores the geometrical variables (IP, vertex position, etc) of the particle.\nTupleToolEventInfo, which stores general information (event number, run number, GPS time, etc) of the event.\n\n \nIn order to add TupleTools to dtt, we have to use the addTupleTool method of DecayTreeTuple (only available when we have from DecayTreeTuple.Configuration import * in our script).\nThis method instantiates the tool, adds it to the list of tools to execute and returns it.\nFor example, if we want to fill the tracking information of our particles, we can add the TupleToolTrackInfo tool in the following way:\ntrack_tool = dtt.addTupleTool('TupleToolTrackInfo')\n\nSome tools can be configured. For example, if we wanted further information from the tracks, such as the number of degrees of freedom of the track fit, we would have to turn on the verbose mode of the tool:\ntrack_tool.Verbose = True\n\nIf we don't need to configure the tool or we want to use the defaults, there's no need for storing the returned tool in a variable.\nFor example, if we wanted the information of the PV associated to our particle, we could just add the TupleToolPrimaries with no further configuration:\ndtt.addTupleTool('TupleToolPrimaries')\n\nThe way the DecayTreeTuple.Decay is written in in our minimal DaVinci job,\ndtt.Decay = '[D*(2010)+ -> (D0 -> K- K+) pi+]CC'\n\nmeans that the configured TupleTools will only run on the head of the decay chain, that is, the D*(2010)+.\nIn order to select the particles for which we want the information stored, we need to mark them with a ^ symbol in the decay descriptor.\nFor example, if we want to fill the information of the D0 and its children, as well as the soft pi+, we would modify the above line to look like this:\ndtt.Decay = '[D*(2010)+ -> ^(D0 -> ^K- ^K+) ^pi+]CC'\n\nThis will run all the configured TupleTools on the marked particles, with the caveat that some tools are only run on certain types of particles (eg, tracking tools on particles that have an associated track).\nThis configuration is not optimal, since there may be tools which we only want to run on the D's and some only on the children. Enter Branches, which allow us to specify which tools get applied to which particle in the decay (in addition to the TupleTools configured at the top level).\nBranches let you define custom namespaces in your ntuple by means of a dict.\nIts keys define the name of each branch (and, as a consequence, the prefix of the corresponding leaves in the ntuple), while the corresponding values are decay descriptors that specify which particles you want to include in the branch.\ndtt.addBranches({'Dstar' : '[D*(2010)+ -> (D0 -> K- K+) pi+]CC',\n                 'D0'    : '[D*(2010)+ -> ^(D0 -> K- K+) pi+]CC',\n                 'Kminus': '[D*(2010)+ -> (D0 -> ^K- K+) pi+]CC',\n                 'Kplus' : '[D*(2010)+ -> (D0 -> K- ^K+) pi+]CC',\n                 'pisoft': '[D*(2010)+ -> (D0 -> K- K+) ^pi+]CC'})\n\nNote that in order to use branches, we have to make sure that all particles we want to use are marked in the main decay descriptor (dtt.Decay).\nDaVinci will ignore branches for particles that have not been marked in dtt.Decay!\nOnce the branches have been configured, they can be accessed as dtt.PARTICLENAMEand TupleTools can be added as discussed before.\nFor example, if we want to store the proper time information of the D0, we would do\ndtt.D0.addTupleTool('TupleToolPropertime')\n\n Do I really have to type my decay descriptor that many times?No! You can use the (new) dtt.setDescriptorTemplate() method to set up your \ndecay descriptor and branches in just one line!\nWell, nearly: because this is a new feature it is not available in most released versions of DaVinci, but this snippet will add it to an older version.\nWith that out of the way, you can simply use\ndtt.setDescriptorTemplate('${Dstar}[D*(2010)+ -> ${D0}(D0 -> ${Kminus}K- ${Kplus}K+) ${pisoft}pi+]CC')\n\nThis will set up both dtt.Decay and Branches for you.\n \nThe usage of Branches is very important (and strongly encouraged) to keep the size of your ntuples small, since it prevents us from storing unneeded information (for example trigger information, which will be discussed at a later lesson).\n Where to find TupleToolsOne of the most difficult things is to know which tool we need to add to our \nDecayTreeTuple in order to get the information we want.\nFor this, it is necessary to know where to find TupleTools and their code.\nTupleTools are spread in 9 packages under Analysis/Phys (see the master branch in git here), all starting with the prefix DecayTreeTuple, according to the type of information they fill in our ntuple:\n\nDecayTreeTuple for the more general tools.\nDecayTreeTupleANNPID for the NeuralNet-based PID tools.\nDecayTreeTupleDalitz for Dalitz analysis.\nDecayTreeTupleJets for obtaining information on jets.\nDecayTreeTupleMC gives us access to MC-level information.\nDecayTreeTupleMuonCalib for muon calibration tools.\nDecayTreeTupleReco for reconstruction-level information, such as TupleToolTrackInfo.\nDecayTreeTupleTracking for more detailed tools regarding tracking.\nDecayTreeTupleTrigger for accessing to the trigger information of the candidates.\n\nThe TupleTools are placed in the src folder within each package and it's usually easy to get what they do just by looking at their name.\nHowever, the best way to know what a tool does is check its documentation, either by opening its .h file or be searching for it in the latest doxygen.\nMost tools are very well documented and will also inform you of their configuration options.\nAs an example, to get the information on the TupleToolTrackInfo we used before we could either check its source code or its web documentation.\n In case we need more information or need to know exactly what the code does, the fill method is the one we need to look at.\n As a shortcut, the list of tupletools can also be found in doxygen at the top of the pages for the IParticleTupleTool and the IEventTupleTool interfaces (depending on whether they fill information about specific particles or the event in general).\n \nThe updated options can be found here.\n Test your ntupleRun the options in the same way as in the minimal DaVinci \njob lesson.\nYou will obtain a DVntuple.root file, which we can open and inspect with ROOT's TBrowser:\n$ root DVntuple.root\nroot [0]\nAttaching file DVntuple.root as _file0...\nroot [1] TBrowser *b = new TBrowser()\nroot [2]\nTry to locate the branches we have added, which are placed in the TupleDstToD0pi_D0ToKpi/DecayTree, and plot some distributions by double-clicking the leaves.\n \nPicking up with the LoKi functors lesson, let's store some specific bits of information discussed there in our ntuple.\nTo add LoKi-based leaves to the tree, we need to use the LoKi::Hybrid::TupleTool, which is configured with 3 arguments:\n\nIts name, specified in the addTupleTool call after a /.  This is \nvery useful (and recommended) if we want to have different \nLoKi::Hybrid::TupleTool for each of our branches. For instance, we may \nwant to add different information for the D*, the D0 and the soft $$\\pi$$:dstar_hybrid = dtt.Dstar.addTupleTool('LoKi::Hybrid::TupleTool/LoKi_Dstar')\nd0_hybrid = dtt.D0.addTupleTool('LoKi::Hybrid::TupleTool/LoKi_D0')\npisoft_hybrid = dtt.pisoft.addTupleTool('LoKi::Hybrid::TupleTool/LoKi_PiSoft')\n\n\nThe Preambulo property, which lets us perform preprocessing of the LoKi \nfunctors to simplify the code that is used to fill the leaves, for example \ncreating combinations of LoKi functors or performing mathematical \noperations:preamble = [\n   'DZ = VFASPF(VZ) - BPV(VZ)',\n   'TRACK_MAX_PT = MAXTREE(ISBASIC & HASTRACK, PT, -1)'\n]\ndstar_hybrid.Preambulo = preamble\nd0_hybrid.Preambulo = preamble\n\n\nThe Variables property, consisting of a dict of (variable name, LoKi \nfunctor) pairs. In here, LoKi functors can be used, as well as any \nvariable we may have defined in the Preambulo:dstar_hybrid.Variables = {\n   'mass': 'M',\n   'mass_D0': 'CHILD(M, 1)',\n   'pt': 'PT',\n   'dz': 'DZ',\n   'dira': 'BPVDIRA',\n   'max_pt': 'MAXTREE(ISBASIC & HASTRACK, PT, -1)',\n   'max_pt_preambulo': 'TRACK_MAX_PT',\n   'sum_pt_pions': 'SUMTREE(211 == ABSID, PT)',\n   'n_highpt_tracks': 'NINTREE(ISBASIC & HASTRACK & (PT > 1500*MeV))'\n}\nd0_hybrid.Variables = {\n   'mass': 'M',\n   'pt': 'PT',\n   'dira': 'BPVDIRA',\n   'vtx_chi2': 'VFASPF(VCHI2)',\n   'dz': 'DZ'\n}\npisoft_hybrid.Variables = {\n   'p': 'P',\n   'pt': 'PT'\n}\n\n\n\nIn the code snippets specified above (available here), you can see that the NINTREE functor counts the number of particles that pass the specified criteria. While this is not very useful for ntuple-building (we can always do it offline), it's a very powerful functor to use when building decay selections.\n Getting more practiceIn the LoKi::Hybrid::TupleToolwe've used some  functors that have not been \ndescribed previously. Find out what they do in the \ndoxygen.\nTo check SUMTREE and CHILD, run the code above and check that the Dstar_max_pt and Dstar_max_pt_preambulo and the Dstar_mass_D0 and D0_mass branches have exactly the same values.\n \n"},"first-analysis-steps/decay-tree-fitter.html":{"url":"first-analysis-steps/decay-tree-fitter.html","title":"How do I use DecayTreeFitter?","keywords":"","body":"How do I use DecayTreeFitter?\n Learning Objectives\nAdd a kinematic fitter to a branch in the decay tree\nApply a mass constraint\nInspect the refitted decay tree\n\n \nOnce you have made a hypothesis on the chain of decays that lead to your final state, you then can incorporate the additional knowledge that comes with this hypothesis to get a new best estimate for the particle parameters -- in particular their momenta. The additional knowledge is represented as constraints, which your decay tree has to fulfill.\nFor example, for the decay\n'[D*(2010)+ -> (D0 -> K- K+) pi+]CC'\n\nyou can make the assumption that the (K- K+) combine to form a D0 with a specific invariant mass. This results in a so called mass-constraint. In addition the kaon and the pion should originate from exactly the same point in space. If you know that your data only contains prompt D candidates, you can constrain them to do come from the primary vertex. Boundary conditions like those are called vertex-constraints*.\nApplying such kinematic constraints leads to new best estimates for the track parameters of the final state particles. The process of calculating those is called a kinematic refit and the TupleToolDecayTreeFitter is the algorithm that performs this task for us.\n The physics and mathematics behind DecayTreeFitterFor details of the method see the paper on Decay chain fitting with a Kalman \nfilter.\n \nSo how do we use a TupleToolDecayTreeFitter to our DaVinci script? Let's create a branch to add the tool to. We'll just name it 'Dstar':\ndtt.addBranches({\n    'Dstar': '[D*(2010)+ -> (D0 -> K- K+) pi+]CC',\n})\n\nTo this branch we can now apply the TupleToolDecayTreeFitter.\ndtt.Dstar.addTupleTool('TupleToolDecayTreeFitter/ConsD')\n\nNow we can proceed with the configuration of the fitter. We are going to constrain the decay tree to the primary vertex of origin. We want all the output available, so we set the verbose option. Finally we want to apply the mass constraint on the D0:\ndtt.Dstar.ConsD.constrainToOriginVertex = True\ndtt.Dstar.ConsD.Verbose = True\ndtt.Dstar.ConsD.daughtersToConstrain = ['D0']\n\nNote that you can constrain more than one intermediate state at once if that fits your decay.\nWhen using the DecayTreeFitter in a DecayTreeTuple, all the variables created by the other TupleTools are not affected by the change, but some new variables are created, one set per DecayTreeFitter instance. Depending on whether the Verbose option is specified, the new variables are created for the head particle only or for the head particle and its daughters too.\nIf the daughters are not stable particles and decay further, the daughters of the daughters have no new variables associated to them by default.\nSince in many cases this information might be useful, there is an option to store the information from those tracks\ndtt.Dstar.ConsD.UpdateDaughters = True\n\n DecayTreeFitter and LoKi functorsAlternatively, many of the operations described above can done by using the \nDecayTreeFitter via LoKi functors, see the DaVinci \ntutorial for \ndetails.\n \n Which constraints to applyIt is important to be aware what assumptions you bake into your ntuple. For \nexample, after you require the vertex constraint you must be careful if using \nthe IPCHI2_OWNPV, since the particle you are looking at is forced to point \nto the PV. Which constraints make most sense for you depends on the questions \nyou want to ask in your analysis, so ask your supervisor/working group in case \nof doubt.\n \nOnce you have produced your ntuple you can have a look at the refitted variables.\nroot -l DVntuple.root\nTupleDstToD0pi_D0ToKK->cd()\nDecayTree->StartViewer()\n\nPlotting the raw mass of the D* (without the fit) Dstar_M you should see a broad signal around 2 GeV:\n\n Which mass variable to useIn many ntuples you also find a mass variable called _MM. This confusingly \nrefers to measured mass. However, it is usually better to use _M. _MM is \nthe sum of the 4-momenta of the final state particles extrapolated back to the \nfitted vertex position, but not the result of the actual vertex fit.\n \nNow let us look at the refitted mass of the D*, with the D0 constrained to its nominal mass. It is stored in the variable Dstar_ConsD_M. If you plot this you will note that some values are unphysical. So, let's restrict the range we look at to something that makes sense.\nOn the root prompt use the arrow-up key to get the last draw command and modify it to pipe the output into a histogram:  \ntv__tree->Draw(\"Dstar_ConsD_M>>h(200,2000,2030)\",\"\",\"\");\n\n\nNote that this plot has 356 entries, although we only have 128 candidates in the raw mass spectrum. The reason for this is, that we typically have several primary vertices per event. When you use the vertex contraint, the fitter is run for each of the possible vertex hypothesis available in the event. So all the Dstar_ConsD-xxx variables are in fact arrays, where the first value corresponds to the best PV hypothesis. We can plot only those by doing\ntv__tree->Draw(\"Dstar_ConsD_M[0]>>h(200,2000,2030)\",\"\",\"\");\n\nand we get the final kinematically refitted Dstar mass:\n\nFinally, let's check how the D0 mass constraint has played out.\ntv__tree->Draw(\"Dstar_ConsD_D0_M[0]>>h(100,1800,1900)\",\"\",\"\", 128, 0);\n\n\nAs expected, the D0 candidates are forced onto their PDG mass value.\n Explore\nLook at the status variable to check if the fits converged.\nLook at the chi2 distribution of the fit\n\n \nDecayTreeFitter can be told to change some of the hypotheses in the decay tree. This is very useful if you want to slightly change which decays you want to look at. As an example let's say we want to examine the Cabibbo-suppressed decay of the D0 into pi- pi+ instead of K- pi+. For this we add a second fitter, giving it a new name ConsDpipi:\ndtt.Dstar.addTupleTool('TupleToolDecayTreeFitter/ConsDpipi')\ndtt.Dstar.ConsDpipi.constrainToOriginVertex = True\ndtt.Dstar.ConsDpipi.Verbose = True\ndtt.Dstar.ConsDpipi.daughtersToConstrain = ['D0']\n\nWe now can tell the fitter to substitute one of the kaons in the D0 decay by a pion.\ndtt.Dstar.ConsDpipi.Substitutions = {\n    'Charm -> (D0 -> ^K- K+) Meson': 'pi-',\n    'Charm -> (D~0 -> ^K+ K-) Meson': 'pi+',\n    'Charm -> (D0 -> K- ^K+) Meson': 'pi+',\n    'Charm -> (D~0 -> K+ ^K-) Meson': 'pi-'}\n\nIn the dictionary that is passed to the Substitutions property of the fitter, the keys are decay descriptors, where the respective particle to be substituted is marked with a ^. The values are the respective new particle hypotheses. The substitution will only work if you start from a decay descriptor that actually matches your candidates. However, you are allowed to generalise parts of the decay. Here we replaced D*(2010) with the more general Charm and the bachelor pi- is just represented by a Meson.\nNote that the substitution mechanism does not understand the CC symbol. Both charge states have to be specified explicitely.\nRunning the ntuple script again with these additions gives you fit results for the re-interpreted decay.\n Challenge\nCompare the outcome of the two fits with the different mass hypothesis\nCompare the fit quality between the correct and the the wrong hypothesis\n\n \nThe solution to this exercise ntuple_DTF1.py, is available\nhere.\n"},"first-analysis-steps/ganga-data.html":{"url":"first-analysis-steps/ganga-data.html","title":"More Ganga","keywords":"","body":"More Ganga\n Learning Objectives\nSet the input data with BKQuery\nUse LHCbDatasets\nSet the location of the output of our jobs\nSet the location of your .gangadir\nAccess output stored on the grid\n\n \nThe input data can be specified for your job with the BKQuery tool.

This location points us to the gangadir where ganga stores information about the jobs and the output. If we have lots of jobs with large files the file system where the gangadir is located will quickly fill up.\n Setting the gangadir locationThe location of the gangadir can be changed in the configuration file \n'~/.gangarc'. Just search for the gangadir attribute and change it to where \nyou like (on the CERN AFS the work area is a popular choice).\n \nTo avoid filling up the filespace it is wise to put the large files produced by your job somewhere with lots of storage - the grid. You can do so by setting the outputfiles attribute:\nj.outputfiles = [DiracFile('*.root'), LocalFile('stdout')]\n\nThe DiracFile will be stored in your user area on the grid (with up to 2TB personal capacity) from where you can access it with the accessURL() function as before. The wildcard means that any root file produced by your job will stay on the grid. LocalFile downloads the file to your gangadir, in this case the one called stdout.\nSmall files are downloaded as standard: .root, logfiles etc. Files that are expected to be large which have extensions .dst etc are by default kept on the grid as Dirac files. In general you are encouraged to keep your large files on the grid to avoid moving large amounts of data around through your work area.\n Getting help with gangaTo find out more take a look at the Ganga \nFAQ\n \n"},"first-analysis-steps/eos-storage.html":{"url":"first-analysis-steps/eos-storage.html","title":"Storing large files on EOS","keywords":"","body":"Storing large files on EOS\n Learning Objectives\nRun a ganga job which puts output onto EOS\nOpen and view the files on EOS\n\n \nDuring a real analysis the output of your jobs will quickly grow\nbeyond what fits onto your AFS space. CERN provides you with 2TB of\nspace on a set of hard drives called the EOS\nservice and\na grid storage quota of 2TB.\nTo retrieve a job outputfile, one can use three types of files:  \n\nLocalFile: the standard one with the output file directly downloaded to\nthe gangadir.  \nDiracFile: the output file is stored directly on the grid and be accessed\nthrough the XRootD protocol.  \n\nIn this lesson, we will focus on the use of DiracFile in ganga to manage big\noutput files.\nWe can reuse what has been done to run a DaVinci job on the\ngrid and adapt the j.outputfiles part.\nTo add the DiracFile in the configuration of the job we just need:\nj = Job(name='First ganga job')\nmyApp = GaudiExec()\nmyApp.directory = \"./DaVinciDev_v42r6p1\"\nj.application = myApp\nj.application.options = ['code/davinci-grid/ntuple_options_grid.py']\nj.application.readInputData('data/MC_2016_27163002_Beam6500GeV2016MagDownNu1.625nsPythia8_Sim09b_Trig0x6138160F_Reco16_Turbo03_Stripping28NoPrescalingFlagged_ALLSTREAMS.DST.py')\nj.backend = Dirac()\nj.outputfiles = [\n    DiracFile('DVntuple.root')\n]\nj.submit()\n\nWhen the job is completed, no output is dowloaded but some interesting\ninformation are provided by typing j.outputfiles[0]:\nDiracFile(namePattern='DVntuple.root',\n          lfn='/lhcb/user/a/another/2016_11/146255/146255492/DVntuple.root',\n          localDir='/afs/cern.ch/user/a/another/gangadir/workspace/another/LocalXML/129/output')\n\nApart from the namePattern which was set during the configuration of the job,\nwe can retrieve the localDir which is the path in your gangadir to the output\nof the job and its lfn which stands for Logical File Name.\nThis LFN can then be given as an argument in order to download the file. But\nmore important in most of the cases, you don't even need to download the file\nthanks to the accessURL function which will give you the URL of your output\nfile by typing j.outputfiles[0].accessURL():\n['root://eoslhcb.cern.ch//eos/lhcb/grid/user/lhcb/user/a/another/2016_11/146255/146255492/DVntuple.root']\n\nThis URL can be directly used in your ROOT script with the help of the XRootD\nprotocol as follows:  \nTFile::Open(\"root://eoslhcb.cern.ch//eos/lhcb/grid/user/lhcb/user/a/another/2016_11/146255/146255492/DVntuple.root\")\n\n Use of the XRootD protocol In order to access files on every grid site with the XRootD protocol, be sure\nto have a valid proxy using lhcb-proxy-init.\n \n Deprecation of the use of MassStorageFileThe use of MassStorageFile is deprecated as it is quite sensitive to network \nproblems when ganga is downloading the output of the job to EOS.  \n \nganga needs configuring in order to know which files to store on\nEOS, as well as where on EOS to store them. Open ~/.gangarc in your\nfavourite editor and look for a line that starts with\nMassStorageFile. In ganga a MassStorageFile represents a file\nstored on something like EOS or CASTOR.  Change it to look like the\nfollowing:\nMassStorageFile = {'fileExtensions': [''],\n                   'uploadOptions': {'path': '/eos/lhcb/user/a/another',\n                                     'cp_cmd': '/afs/cern.ch/project/eos/installation/lhcb/bin/eos.select cp',\n                                     'ls_cmd': '/afs/cern.ch/project/eos/installation/lhcb/bin/eos.select ls',\n                                     'mkdir_cmd': '/afs/cern.ch/project/eos/installation/lhcb/bin/eos.select mkdir'\n                                    },\n                   'backendPostprocess': {'LSF': 'WN', 'Dirac': 'client',\n                                          'LCG': 'client', 'ARC': 'client', \n                                          'CREAM': 'client', 'Localhost': 'WN',\n                                          'Interactive': 'client'}\n                  }\n\nThe line should look very similar to this already, the only thing that\nneeds changing is the path entry. You should change it to your EOS home directory\nwhich is /eos/lhcb/user/a/another if your username is another.\n Automatically transfer filesYou can use the fileExtensions entry to specify a list of file\nextensions that should be transfered to EOS by default. For the\nmoment leave this set to [''].\n \nRelated to this there is an entry for DiracFiles, which represent\nfiles stored on the Grid. By default any file ending in .dst will\nnot be downloaded nor stored on EOS. It will be stored on some storage\nelement on the Grid. For files which you do not plan to work with\ninteractively and instead feed into a different grid job it makes\nsense to leave them on the grid.\nNote that EOS is 'Grid storage', specifically that which is located at CERN. Your personal space, at /eos/lhcb/user//, is just another location on EOS, and happens to be different to the default location used by DIRAC for 'grid storage'.\nDiracFile = {'fileExtensions': ['*.dst'],\n             'uploadOptions': {},\n             'backendPostprocess': {'LSF': 'WN', 'Dirac': 'WN',\n                                    'LCG': 'WN', 'CREAM': 'WN',\n                                    'Localhost': 'WN',\n                                    'Interactive': 'WN'}\n            }\n\nNow that ganga is configured we will modify the minimal DaVinci\njob to store the nTuple it produces on EOS.\nMake a copy of first-job.py and add the following three lines\nbefore the j.submit() line:\nf = MassStorageFile('DVntuple.root')\nf.outputfilenameformat = '/starterkit/{jid}_{fname}'\nj.outputfiles = [f]\n\nganga uses the string you pass to a MassStorageFile constructor to\nmatch which files created by your job this MassStorageFile object\nrepresents. In this case only files named DVntuple.root will match.\nThe outputfilenameformat tells ganga where inside your EOS area to\nstore the file and how to name it. The full path to this particular\nfile will be:\n/eos/lhcb/user/a/another/starterkit/{jid}_{fname}\n\n Special outputfileformat patternsYour outputfilenameformat string can contain several special\nstrings which will be replaced on a file by file basis. The special\nstrings are: {jid}, {sjid} and {fname}. They stand for job ID,\nsubjob ID, and the filename of the matched file respectively.\n \n Subjobs and outputfileformatWhen using subjobs it is important to make sure you include the\n{sjid} pattern in your outputfilenameformat string, otherwise\nall the subjobs will overwrite each others output.\n \nThe final line tells your ganga job that the outputfiles of this\njob that need special treatment.\nOne important thing to note is that ganga has to be running after\nyour job has completed to copy the files to EOS. The job can not\ncopy things to EOS itself. You can leave ganga running in a\nscreen session and it will copy files as they\nbecome available.\nOnce your job has completed and the files have been copied to\nEOS by ganga you can access them from your terminal by mounting\nyour EOS area.\n Important!Important: mounting eos is discouraged by the LHCb data management team,\nand no support will be provided by them for problems/questions related to it.\n \nOn lxplus EOS is mount under /eos like this:\n$ ls -al /eos/user\n\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x. 1 daemon root 269935142640435 Oct  6  2014 .\ndrwxr-xr-x. 9 root   root               0 Oct 24 11:30

Objectives\nLearn how to process many files in parallel on the grid\nby splitting a job into many subjobs\n\n \nIn the previous lesson, you've submitted a job to the LHC grid.\nYou will notice that the job will take a long time to finish.\nThis is because it has to process many gigabytes of data.\nganga provides several splitters that implement strategies for processing data in parallel.\nThe one we will use now is SplitByFiles, which spawns several subjobs, each of which only processes a certain number of files.\nApart from processing data faster, this will also allow you to work with datasets that are spread across several sites of the LHC grid.\nThis is because a job can only access datasets that are available on the site that it runs on.\nTo activate a splitter, assign it to the .splitter attribute of your job:\nj.splitter = SplitByFiles(filesPerJob=5)\n\nNote that the specified number of files per job is only the allowed maximum.\nYou will often get jobs with fewer files.\n How do I choose the number of files per job?Choose fewer files per job if possible, as this will allow you to finish sooner \nand reduces the impact of jobs failing due to grid problems.\nSetting filesPerJob=5 should work well for real data, while filesPerJob=1 should be good for signal MC.\n \nNow, when you run j.submit(), the job will automatically be split into several subjobs.\nThese can be displayed by entering\njobs(787).subjobs\n\nin ganga, where you have to replace 787 with the id of your main job.\nYou can access individual subjobs as in jobs(787).subjobs(2).\nFor example, to resubmit a failed subjob, you would run\njobs(787).subjobs(2).resubmit()\n\nTo access several subjobs at once, you can use the .select method:\njobs(787).subjobs.select(status='failed').resubmit()\n\nThis will resubmit all failed subjobs.\nIf you want to do something more complex with each subjob, a regular for-loop can be used as well:\nfor j in jobs(787).subjobs:\n    print(j.id)\n\nIt's possible that some of your subjobs will be stuck in a certain state (submitting/completing/...).\nIf that is the case, try to reset the Dirac backend:\njobs(787).subjobs(42).backend.reset()\n\nIf that doesn't help, try failing the job and resubmitting:\njobs(787).subjobs(42).force_status('failed')\njobs(787).subjobs(42).resubmit()\n\nIt can take quite a while to submit all of your subjobs.\nIf you want to continue working in ganga while submitting jobs, you can use the queues feature to do just that.\nSimply call queues.add with the submit function of a job without adding parentheses, like this:\nqueues.add(j.submit)\nGanga will then submit this job (and its subjobs) in the background.\nMake sure not to close ganga before the submission is finished, or you will have to start submitting the rest of the jobs again later on.\n Splitting your first jobTry splitting the ganga job from our previous lesson with splitByFiles=1 \n(reference code) and submit it with ganga.\n

to work with and modify LHCb software projects and packages\nLearn how to find and search the source code and its documentation\n\n \n PrerequisitesBefore starting, you should have a basic understanding of how to use git,\nsimilar to what has been\ntaught during the\nStarterkit.\n \nIn this lesson, we'll show you a complete workflow for developing the LHCb\nsoftware using the git version control system.  At LHCb, we use Gitlab to\nmanage our git repositories.  Among other features, Gitlab allows you to browse\nthe source code for each project, and to review new changes (called merge\nrequests) in a convenient web interface.  You can find the CERN Gitlab\ninstance at https://gitlab.cern.ch.\nIn principle, there are multiple ways of interacting with the LHCb software\nrepositories:\n\nA vanilla git workflow using only the standard git commands.  This requires\nyou to clone and compile an entire LHCb project at a time.\nAn LHCb-specific workflow using a set of lb-* subcommands.  This allows\nyou to check out individual packages inside a project, and streamlines the\nmodification of a few packages at a time.  (This is closer to the previously\nused getpack command.)\n\nHere, we want to focus on the second workflow. The first workflow will be\ndiscussed briefly at the bottom of\nthis page. Note that, although the lb-git commands are much easier for small\nchanges to existing packages where recompiling an entire project would be\ncumbersome, for any serious development the usage of vanilla git is much more\nstable. Please consider using it if you can spare the compilation time.\n Initial setupBefore jumping in by creating a project in Gitlab, you should make sure that\nyour local git configuration and your settings on Gitlab are sufficiently set\nup.\n\nYour name and email address should be set up in your local git\nconfiguration.  To ensure that this is the case, run\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\ngit config --global user.email \"Your Name \"\nand put in your information.\n\nNext, connect to https://gitlab.cern.ch and log in with your CERN \ncredentials. Visit https://gitlab.cern.ch/profile/keys and add an SSH key.\n\nFinally, run this LHCb-specific configuration command:\ngit config --global lb-use.protocol ssh\nThis makes sure the LHCb commands use the ssh protocol instead of https.\n\n\n \nThis lesson introduces you the commands:\n\nlb-dev for setting up a new development environment\ngit lb-use and git lb-checkout for downloading LHCb software packages\n\nIf you want to make changes to a software package, you will need to set up a\ndevelopment environment. lb-dev is your friend here:\nlb-dev --name DaVinciDev DaVinci/v42r6p1\n\nThe output should look similar to this:\nSuccessfully created the local project DaVinciDev in .\n\nTo start working:\n\n  > cd ./DaVinciDev\n  > git lb-use DaVinci\n  > git lb-checkout DaVinci/vXrY MyPackage\n\nthen\n\n  > make\n  > make test\n\nand optionally (CMake only)\n\n  > make install\n\nYou can customize the configuration by editing the files 'build.conf' and\n'CMakeLists.txt' (see http://cern.ch/gaudi/CMake for details).\n lb-dev created local projects are Git repositoriesWhen lb-dev creates the local project directory and create the initial\nfiles there, it also calls git init and commits to the local Git repository\nthe first version of the files (try with git log in there).\nYou can then use git to keep track of your development, and share your code\nwith others (for example with a new project in\ngitlab.cern.ch).\n \nFollow those instructions to compile the software:\ncd DaVinciDev\ngit lb-use DaVinci\nmake\n\nOnce that's done, you can do\n./run bash -l\n\ninside the directory. This will (similar to lb-run) give you a new bash\nsession with the right environment variables set, from which you can run\nproject-specific commands such as gaudirun.py.\nYour new development environment won't be very useful without any software to\nmodify and build.  So let's check out one of the existing LHCb packages! These\nare stored in the LHCb Git repositories.\nIn order to obtain the source code of the package you want to work on, we'll\nuse the Git4LHCb scripts.\nThese are a set of aliases, starting with git lb-, that are designed to make\ndeveloping LHCb software easier.  For example, if you want to write a custom\nstripping selection, execute the following in the DaVinciDev directory:\ngit lb-use Stripping\ngit lb-checkout Stripping/master Phys/StrippingSelections\nmake configure\n\nUnder the hood, git lb-use will add the\nStripping repository as a remote in\ngit – check this with git remote -v!  git lb-checkout will then perform a\npartial checkout of the master branch of the Stripping repository, only\nadding the files under\nPhys/StrippingSelections.\n Which project to use in `git lb-use`?The project name to pass to git lb-use depends on the directories you want\nto check out and work on, and not on the project name you passed to lb-dev.\nMoreover you can call git lb-use several times for different remote\nprojects in the same local project:\nlb-dev --name DaVinciDev DaVinci/v42r6p1\ncd DaVinciDev\ngit lb-use Analysis\ngit lb-use Stripping\ngit lb-use DaVinci\n\nNot that in order for this to work, projects you specify in lb-use may not\ndepend on the project you specify in lb-dev. In other words, the top-level\nproject should be at the top of the dependency\nchain.\n \nYou can now modify the StrippingSelections package and run make purge &&\nmake to build it with your changes.  You can test your changes with the\n./run script.  It works similar to lb-run, without the need to specify a\npackage and version:\n./run gaudirun.py options.py\n\n What if `git` asks for my password?Make sure you succesfully completed the instructions under initial\nsetup.\n \nIf you have made changes that you'd like to be integrated into the official\nLHCb repositories, you can use git lb-push to push it to a new branch in the\ncentral git repository. But please read the instructions in the TWiki\npage\nfirst.\nDepending on the project, you may be required to document your changes in the\nrelease notes which are found in doc/release.notes.\nNote that no-one has permission to push directly to the master branch of any\nproject. In order to get your changes merged there from the branch to which you\nlb-pushed, you need to create a merge request, so the project maintainer can\ninspect your code. This can be done on the project repository web \npage, for\nexample.\n Quick link to create a merge requestWhen pushing to a branch in a project in Gitlab you will see a message like:\nremote:\nremote: Create merge request for my-branch:\nremote:   https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb/Stripping/merge_requests/new?merge_request%5Bsource_branch%5D=my-branch\nremote:\nYou can use the URL in the message to quickly create a merge request for the\nchanges you just pushed.\n \nWhen your merge request is approved (which can be after some additional commits\non your part), your changes are part of the master branch of the respective\nproject, and your contributions are officially part of the LHCb software stack.\nCongratulations!\n NightliesIt is advisable to test new developments on the so-called nightly\nbuilds. Each project is built overnight\n(hence the name), and all pending merge requests are applied. You can use a\nnightly build version of a project with:\nlb-dev --nightly lhcb-head DaVinci/HEAD\n\nA more detailed description of the command is found here:\n\nSoftwareEnvTools\n\nSometimes mistakes happen and the committed code is either not compiling or\ndoes not do what it is supposed to do.  Therefore the nightly tests are\nperformed. They first try to build the full software stack.\nIf that is successful, they run some reference jobs and compare the output of\nthe new build with a reference file.  The results of the nightly builds can\nbe found here.\n\nNightly builds summaries\n\nIf the aim of the commit was to change the ouput, e.g. because you increased\nthe track reconstruction efficiency by a factor of two, mention it in the\nmerge request description, such that the manager of the affected project can\nupdate the reference file.\n \nIf you want to take a look the source code, without checking it out, you can\neasily access the repository through the Gitlab web\ninterface. This website also provides search\nfunctionality, but the output is not always easy to read, especially if it\nreturns many hits. To search a project much quicker, you can use Lbglimpse.\nIt allows you to search for a given string in the source code of a particular\nLHCb project.\nLbglimpse \"PVRefitter\" DaVinci v42r6p1\n\nThis works with every LHCb project and released version. Since it's a shell\ncommand, you can easily process the output using less, grep, and other\ntools.\nTo get an idea of how a certain component of the LHCb software works, you can\nalso access the doxygen documentation. One set of doxygen web pages is\ngenerated for several related projects, and is linked in all the projects web\nsites, like for DaVinci.\nSee also the LHCb Computing web page for a\nlist of projects.\n Working with a full project checkoutThe lb-git commands are not strictly necessary, but they're very convenient\nif you just want to quickly edit one package. Otherwise you'd have to build\nthe entire project in which the package is residing, instead of using the\nprecompiled version. However, if you develop across multiple packages, or\nwant to use more sophisticated git commands, nothing prevents you from\nchecking out an entire project – just don't be surprised if it takes O(hours)\nto compile!\nTo check out a project, run the following:\ngit clone https://:@gitlab.cern.ch:8443/lhcb/DaVinci.git\n\nreplacing DaVinci with the project name of your choice. Next, initialise\nand compile it:\nlb-project-init make\n\noptionally followed by make test to run the tests and/or make install to\ninstall it to the InstallArea directory. That's all! You now have a vanilla\ngit repository containing all the source files of the project.\n \n"},"first-analysis-steps/asking-questions.html":{"url":"first-analysis-steps/asking-questions.html","title":"Asking good questions","keywords":"","body":"Asking good questions\n Learning Objectives\nHow to ask a good question\nWhere to ask questions\n\n \nEventually you will get stuck when trying to do something.\nThis lesson is about how to get help with getting unstuck.\nPeople love helping others. Below some tips on how to improve\nyour chances of getting a good answer. The answers you get\nwill depend very much on the way you ask your question.\n Mailing listsFor LHCb specific questions your best bet are the LHCb mailing\nlists like: \nlhcb-distributed-analysis@cern.ch,\nlhcb-davinci@cern.ch,\nand lhcb-soft-talk@cern.ch. \nA recent alternative to the mailing lists is the Mattermost chat having dedicated channels ('davinci', 'Distributed Analysis' etc). It is a great place to ask your question if you're not confident enough to write an email to the mailing list, or you'd just prefer a more informal setting. \nFor more general questions Stack Overflow and\nGoogle are good starting places.\n \n LHCb Q&AAnother experimental alternative to the mailing lists is the LHCb Questions and \nAnswers website.\nIt works like Stack overflow, but focuses on LHCb-specific questions.\nYou can post your question there and you should usually receive an answer within a few hours or days.\n \nThe title/subject is the first thing people will see of your\nquestion. If it is not interesting, they will not read the rest.\nIf you are struggling with a good title, write it last! Having\nwritten the rest of your email will give you a better idea of what\nthe one sentence summary is.\n Grammar and spellingThis is a no brainer. You want to make a good impression:\nsomeone who made an effort and values other people's time.\nIf you aren't comfortable with writing in English, ask a friend\nto proof-read your email for you.\n \nMost people like hard problems and thought-provoking questions. So\ngive them an interesting question to chew on, and they will love it.\nDespite this, mailing lists have a reputation for a hostile tone and\nan air of arrogance. People are hostile towards people who seem unwilling\nto think for themselves or did not do their homework before asking their\nquestion.\n VolunteersRemember people are volunteering their time to help you. They have busy\nlives and there are a lot of questions. So they filter ruthlessly. Make\nsure your question is the most interesting one out there, and people\nwill choose to help you.\n \nIt is OK that you are not technically competent, what you need to show is\nthat you have the skills to become competent: alert, thoughtful, observant,\nwilling to be an active partner in developing a solution.\nBefore posting your question try:\n\nSearching the archives of the forum/mailing list\nSearching the web\nFinding the answer in a FAQ\nFinding the answer by experimenting\nAsking a skilled friend\nOr reading the code\n\nWhen asking your question, mention which of these steps you have tried. It\nwill help demonstrate that you are not lazy and put in some effort. If you\nlearned something from trying this, mention it!\nThe beginning of your email should explain what you are trying to do and\nwhy, as well as where the problem occurs. Often it is useful to describe\nthe big goal, and not the particular step you are stuck with.\nHelp others reproduce your problem by including the necessary details. If\nthe problem is with code you wrote, include it. However do not post all of your\nprogram. Try and make a minimal example that demonstrates the problem. Stack\nOverflow has a good guide on creating a minimal, complete, and verifiable\nexample.\nYou have to be precise. Do not simply dump all possible information that\nmight be relevant. Vague questions receive vague answers. Being precise is\nuseful for at least three reasons. One: being seen to invest effort in simplifying\nthe question makes it more likely you'll get an answer, Two: simplifying\nthe question makes it more likely you'll get a useful answer. Three: In\nthe process of refining your bug report, you may develop a fix or workaround yourself.\nWhen people post replies or questions about your problem, follow them up. If\nyou manage to solve your problem, tell the mailing list.\n Love letters also known as private repliesPlease do not reply to questions privately. We are trying to solve a technical\nissue, not writing lover letters. If you take the discussion\noff the mailing list future generations will just see the question and no\nsolution. You will also miss out on help from others that did not chime\nin to your first question but might be able to help later on.\n \nOnce the problem is solved post a final message saying that the problem is\nsolved and what the solution is.\nA lot of the material in this topic was taken from the following, excellent\nguides to asking good questions:\n\nHow To Ask Questions The Smart Way by\nEric Raymond\nWriting the perfect question\nby Jon Skeet\nHow do I ask a good question? on Stack Overflow\n\n"},"first-analysis-steps/ecgd.html":{"url":"first-analysis-steps/ecgd.html","title":"Early career, gender and diversity","keywords":"","body":"Early career, gender and diversity\n Learning Objectives\nKnow about the existence of the ECGD office, where ECGD means Early Career, \nGender and Diversity.\nMeet the ECGD representatives\nLearn how/when the ECGD office can be useful for you.\n\n \nThe aim of the ECGD is to help LHCb achieve a working environment in which all LHCb members can thrive.

Therefore, to build $$D^\\ast\\rightarrow D^0(\\rightarrow K^{-} \\pi^{+}) \\pi$$ we need to\n\nGet input pions and kaons and filter them according to our physics needs.\nCombine a pion and a kaon to build a $$D^0$$, and apply selection cuts to it.\nCombine this $$D^0$$ with a pion to build the $$D^\\ast$$, again filtering when necessary.\n\nTo do that, we need to know a little bit more about how the LHCb analysis framework works.\nAs discussed in the Gaudi introduction, Gaudi is based on the event-by-event sequential (chained) execution of algorithms wrapped in a GaudiSequencer, which takes care of handling the execution order such that processing stops when an algorithm is not passed.\nHowever, it does not handle the data dependencies between these algorithms nor does it give easy access to them.\nTo solve this problem, the Selection Framework was created, and it is based on two types of objects: Selection and SelectionSequence:\n\nThe Selection is the basic unit of the framework. It uses DaVinci algorithms to process LHCb::Particlesand writes them to a TES location easily findable through its outputLocation method. Additionally, it knows about other Selections that it requires to pass in order to obtain input particles through its RequiredSelections argument. A Selection requires all of its RequiredSelections to pass.\n\nThe SelectionSequence takes a Selection object, resolves its Selection requirements, and builds a flat, chained and ordered list of Selections. It then exports (via the selection method) a self-contained GaudiSequencer with all the algorithm configurables necessary to run the selection.\nIt also makes the output locations of the data written by the selection chain available via the outputLocations method.\n\n\nAdditionally, we need algorithms to perform the particle combination and filtering (or other data processing capabilities), since Selections don't do any work by themselves, but just organize the dependencies properly.\nTwo of the most important data processing algorithms are CombineParticles and FilterDesktop, which will be discussed in the next lesson.\nThe advantages of using this framework are several:\n\nBuilding the algorithms with bare Configurables and chaining their Input and Output is a responsibility of the users.\nThis means the user needs to put the algorithms in the correct order, not only chaining properly the inputs/outputs but also executing the algorithms in sequence. The use of the Selection Framework places all algorithms in correct sequences in the optimal order, allowing to achieve the maximal possible CPU efficiency.\nIts reusability: one can use/re-use the same code for data analysis on \"user\"-level for MC processing for building of Stripping lines, since usually only the input particles need to be changed.\nEasiness of debugging: one can visualize the selection chain, for example using the PrintSelection algorithm for debugging of the data flow.\nSome (advanced) tasks are virtually impossible to do without it, such as accessing some features for MC µDST (MCTruth for inclusive lines, for example) or applying the momentum scaling in Turbo.\n\n The LHCb singletons and usabilityA big part of the reusability of the Selection objects is thanks to how the \nLHCb framework is designed:\nall LHCb algorithms need an explicit and unique name because they are singletons (a singleton is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object).\nAs a consequence of this, only one algorithm with a given name can be instantiated.\nThis allows to reuse and reload algorithms that have already been created in a configuration sequence.

Optionally, one can specify also a Preambulo property \nthat allows us to make imports, preprocess functors, etc (more on this in \nthe LoKi functors lesson). \nFor example:\n d0_daughters = {\n   'pi-': '(PT > 750*MeV) & (P > 4000*MeV) & (MIPCHI2DV(PRIMARY) > 4)',\n   'K+': '(PT > 750*MeV) & (P > 4000*MeV) & (MIPCHI2DV(PRIMARY) > 4)'\n }\n\n\nCombinationCut is a particle array LoKi functor (note the A prefix, see more here) that is given the array of particles in a single combination (the children) as input (in our case a kaon and a pion). This cut is applied before the vertex fit so it is typically used to save CPU time by performing some sanity cuts such as AMAXDOCA or ADAMASS before the CPU-consuming fit:\n d0_comb = \"(AMAXDOCA('') \n\nMotherCut is a selection LoKi particle functor that acts on the particle produced by the vertex fit (the parent) from the input particles, which allows to apply cuts on those variables that require a vertex, for example:\n # We can split long selections across multiple lines\n d0_mother = (\n   '(VFASPF(VCHI2/VDOF) 0.9997)'\n   \"& (ADMASS('D0') \nWith all the selections ready, we can build a combiner as\n\n\nfrom Configurables import CombineParticles\nd0 = CombineParticles(\n    'Combine_D0',\n    DecayDescriptor='[D0 -> pi- K+]cc',\n    DaughtersCuts=d0_daughters,\n    CombinationCut=d0_comb,\n    MotherCut=d0_mother\n)\n\n A small question\nDo you understand this selection?\nDo you know what each of these LoKi functors does?\n\n\nNow we have to build a Selection out of it so we can later on put all pieces together:\nfrom PhysConf.Selections import Selection\nd0_sel = Selection(\n    'Sel_D0',\n    Algorithm=d0,\n    RequiredSelections=[Pions, Kaons]\n)\n\nWe can already see that this two-step process (building the CombineParticles and the Selection) is a bit cumbersome.\nThis can be simplified using a SimpleSelection object, which will be discussed in the next lesson.\nFor the time being, let's finish building our candidates.\nNow we can use another CombineParticles to build the $$D^\\ast$$ with pions and the $$D^0$$'s as inputs, and applying a filtering only on the soft pion:\ndstar_daughters = {'pi+': '(TRCHI2DOF  100*MeV)'}\ndstar_comb = \"(ADAMASS('D*(2010)+')  D0 pi+]cc',\n    DaughtersCuts=dstar_daughters,\n    CombinationCut=dstar_comb,\n    MotherCut=dstar_mother\n)\n\ndstar_sel = Selection(\n    'Sel_Dstar',\n    Algorithm=dstar,\n    RequiredSelections=[d0_sel, Pions]\n)\n\n Building shared selectionsIn some cases we may want to build several decays in the same script with \nsome common particles/selection;\nfor example, in our case we could have been building \n\nWe can now build build a SelectionSequence to add to the DaVinci execution sequence\nfrom PhysConf.Selections import SelectionSequence\ndstar_seq = SelectionSequence('Dstar_Seq', TopSelection=dstar_sel)\nfrom Configurables import DaVinci\nDaVinci().UserAlgorithms += [dstar_seq.sequence()]\n\n Work to do\nFinish the script by adapting the basic DaVinci configuration from its \ncorresponding \nlesson and \ncheck the output ntuple (run over 10000 events to make sure your tuple has \nenough entries). The solution can be found \nhere).\nAdd a PrintSelection algorithm in your selections and run again. It gets a \nSelection as input and it can be used the same way, except it will print \nthe decay tree everytime making use of the PrintDecayTree algorithm which \nwas discussed in the Exploring a \nDST lesson.\nCompare your selection with what is done in the actual Stripping, which can be found here. You can appreciate the power of the Selection Framework in the modularity of that Stripping.\n\n\nBy looking at the final script, there is one striking thing:\nthere is a lot of repetition (CombineParticles-Selection sequence) which leads to complicated naming schemes, due to the fact that we want our Selection or CombineParticle objects to have a unique name.\nTo help with these name clashes and to allow a much more streamlined Selection building, the PhysConf.Selections module offers a large set of more optimized classes, which we'll discuss in the next lesson.\n"},"second-analysis-steps/building-decays-part2.html":{"url":"second-analysis-steps/building-decays-part2.html","title":"Modern Selection Framework","keywords":"","body":"Building your own decay\nModern Selection Framework\n Learning Objectives\nBuild a decay chain with the most optimized tools\nLearn the advantages of these specialized tools\n\n \nAs discussed previously, the Selection Framework can become a bit cumbersome in terms of the naming and construction of the Selection-CombineParticles repetitions.\nFor this reason, the Selection Framework offers a more streamlined set of Selections to deal with these issues.\nThis two-step process for building the Selection (creating an algorithm and building a selection with it) can be simplified by using a helper function in the PhysConf.Selections module, called SimpleSelection.\nIt gets a selection name, the algorithm type we want to run, the inputs and any other parameters that need to be passed to the algorithm (as keyword arguments), and returns a Selection object build in the same two-step way.\nWith that in mind, we can rewrite the previous two pieces of code as\nimport GaudiConfUtils.ConfigurableGenerators as ConfigurableGenerators\nfrom PhysConf.Selections import SimpleSelection\nd0_sel = SimpleSelection(\n    'Sel_D0',\n    ConfigurableGenerators.CombineParticles,\n    [Pions, Kaons],\n    DecayDescriptor='([D0 -> pi- K+]CC)',\n    DaughtersCuts=d0_daughters,\n    CombinationCut=d0_comb,\n    MotherCut=d0_mother\n)\n\nNote how we needed to use the CombineParticles from GaudiConfUtils.ConfigurableGenerators instead of the PhysConf.Selections one to make this work.\nThis is because the LHCb algorithms are configured as singletons and it is mandatory to give them a name, which we don't want to in SimpleSelection (we want to skip steps!).\n Why `ConfigurableGenerators`?If we had tried to simply use CombineParticles inside our \nSimpleSelection, we would have seen it fail with the following error\nNameError: Could not instantiate Selection because input Configurable CombineParticles has default name. This is too unsafe to be allowed.\n\nThe reason for this is that all LHCb algorithms need an explicit and unique name.\nThe solution for our problem, in which we actually don't care about the CombineParticles name, is the GaudiConfUtils.ConfigurableGenerators package: it contains wrappers around algorithms such as CombineParticles or FilterDesktop allowing them to be instantiated without an explicit name argument.\n\nIn this case, we could also wonder about the need for the CombineParticles generator.\nWhile SimpleSelection will allow us to do anything we would do with Selection, there exist a few specialized versions of it that allow us to address its most common usages:\n\nCombineSelection is used for the Selection – CombineParticles combination.\nThe previous example would be written then:\nfrom PhysConf.Selections import CombineSelection\nd0_sel = CombineSelection(\n    'Sel_D0',\n    [Pions, Kaons],\n    DecayDescriptor='([D0 -> pi- K+]CC)',\n    DaughtersCuts=d0_daughters,\n    CombinationCut=d0_comb,\n    MotherCut=d0_mother\n)\n\n\nCombine3BodySelection and Combine4BodySelection are the selection version of the DaVinci::N{3,4}BodyDecays DaVinci algorithms (you can see an example of their use as generators here), that allow to perform 3- and 4-body combinations with an improved CPU efficiency thanks to the existence of a set of cuts on the intermediate particle combinations (Combination12Cut, Combination123Cut).\nThese are very useful in timing-critical environments, such as the Stripping.\n\nTupleSelection allows to build a Selection with DecayTreeTuple as an algorithm.\n\nFilterSelection is used to produce a Selection – FilterDesktop combination.\nIt's used in a similar way as CombineSelection.\n\n\n Work to do\nRewrite the previous script to select our signal in terms of \nSimpleSelections and the other algorithms we just learned.\nIntroduce FilterSelection by performing the soft pion selection outside the CombineParticles as discussed in the Building shared selections callout in the previous lesson.\nThe solution can be found here.\n\n\nTo finalize, it is also very useful to know about the existence of certain selection algorithms specialized in filtering according to very commonly used criteria.\nThese can be used as inputs for SimpleSelection to make sure the latter only run on those events that pass the filter.\nThe most interesting are (see the code for the full list, along with examples on how to use them):\n\nTriggerSelection, including L0/Hlt1/Hlt2 specific versions. These are used to filter on certain trigger decisions (NB: their job is simply to filter, so they cannot be used as particle input for another selection).\nThe same interface can be used for filtering on Stripping decisions by using the StrippingSelection class.\nWith it, the example from the Starterkit minimal DaVinci job, in which the output of a Stripping line was passed to DecayTreeTuple, could be written in a more CPU-efficient way:\nline = 'D2hhCompleteEventPromptDst2D2RSLine'\nstrip_sel = StrippingSelection(\"Strip_sel\",\n                               \"HLT_PASS('StrippingD2hhCompleteEventPromptDst2D2RSDecision')\")\nstrip_input = AutomaticData('Phys/{0}/Particles'.format(line))\ntuple_sel = TupleSelection('Tuple_sel',\n                           [strip_sel, strip_input],\n                           Decay='[D*(2010)+ -> (D0 -> K- pi+) pi+]CC')\n\nThis avoids running DecayTreeTuple on empty events, since the strip_sel stops processing before.\nThis will only be helpful for rare Stripping lines, since the overhead of running DecayTreeTuple on empty events is small, but this has been proven useful in more complex workflows.\nAdditionally, it takes care of RootInTes for you.\n\n\n A small testTry running the minimal DaVinci job with and without the StrippingSelection/DecayTreeTuple selections, and compare their performance\nIn this particular case, there is a simple way to achieve a CPU-efficient code with DecayTreeTuple, thanks to the use of DaVinci pre-event filters;\n from PhysConf.Filters import LoKi_Filters\n filter_ = LoKi_Filters(STRIP_Code=\"HLT_PASS('StrippingD2hhCompleteEventPromptDst2D2RSDecision')\")\n\n DaVinci().EventPreFilters = filter_.filters(\"FILTERS\")\n\n\n\nRelated to the previous ones, TisTosSelection are used to filter according to TIS/TOS.\nA whole range of them is available: L0TOSSelection, L0TISSelection, Hlt1TOSSelection, Hlt1TISSelection, Hlt2TOSSelection and Hlt2TISSelection.\n\nValidBPVSelection, which is used to check that a valid associated primary vertex is present.\n\n\nWhile it's hard to find simple examples in which the utility of these tools is clearly highlighted, it's important to note that they constitute a modular framework that allows to build very complex workflows from very simple pieces.\nIn these situations, the Selection Framework is the ideal tool to keep the code bug-free and CPU-efficient.\n"},"second-analysis-steps/fixing-errors.html":{"url":"second-analysis-steps/fixing-errors.html","title":"What to do when something fails","keywords":"","body":"What to do when something fails\n Learning Objectives\nLearn how to read the logs to know where things are breaking\nLearn how to get a glimpse of where algorithms are writing in the TES\n\n \nWhen chaining complex workflows (building particles, combining them, etc) we find that our ntuple is not written while we don't have any errors.\nThe first step is to look at the logs.\nLet's first go back at what we learned when building our own decays and rerun again (saving the output to a log file!).\nWe can scroll through the log until we find our selections, where we will see something like this:\nSel_D0            SUCCESS Number of counters : 13\n |    Counter                                      |     #

data","keywords":"","body":"Run a different stripping line on simulated data\n Learning Objectives\nModify the minimal DecayTreeTuple example to apply a different stripping \nversion to an MC sample\n\n \nIdeally, our simulated samples should feature the same stripping cuts as the real data we want to work with.\nWe can be sure of this if the same stripping version has been used when processing the simulated and real data.\nBut often, our simulated sample will have a different version of the stripping applied to it.\nFor example, what if our data sample uses Stripping 21, while our MC sample uses Stripping 20?\nIn this case, we simply need to rerun our stripping line of choice from the correct stripping version with one caveat:\nthe decisions of the stripping that ran during the central MC production are placed in a default location in the TES (/Event/Strip/Phys/DecReports), so if we try to run our custom stripping it will complain because the location it wants to write the new decisions to already exists.\nTo solve this issue, we need to run an instance of EventNodeKiller to remove the decisions from the MC production so that our custom stripping can write there instead.\nThis is nice, because most tools expect to read the stripping decisions from the default location, so we won't have to reconfigure anything.\nThis example is an extended version of the minimal DaVinci DecayTreeTuple job that additionally runs the corresponding stripping line from Stripping 21.\nTake a look at the file and try to find out what has changed compared to the minimal DaVinci example.\nThe key changes are\n\nRemoving the old stripping reports with a node killer\n\nfrom Configurables import EventNodeKiller\nevent_node_killer =

hypothesis\n Learning Objectives\nCreate a new selection starting from the stripping line output\nChange the particle hypothesis made by the stripping line\n\n \nThere are many situations where you want to repurpose a stripping line to look for a new decay that is similar in topology but distinct from what was put into the stripping line. The easiest thing to do is to change some of the hypothesis on particle IDs made in the stripping. This lesson will show you how to do that.\n Reinterpreting stripping selectionsNote that with this method you can never find more candidates than the \nstripping has already found.  However, you can reinterpret parts of the decay \nto look for new decay modes.\n\nAs an example we will switch the decay of the D0 from (K pi) to (pi pi). \nThere is an algorithm that allows us to replace parts of the decay descriptor called SubstitutePID:\n# configure an algorithm to substitute the Kaon in the D0-decay by a second pion \nfrom Configurables import SubstitutePID\nsubs = SubstitutePID(\n    'MakeD02pipi',\n    Code = \"DECTREE('[D*(2010)+ -> (D0 -> K- pi+) pi+]CC')\",\n    # note that SubstitutePID can't handle automatic CC\n    Substitutions = {\n        'Charm -> (D0 -> ^K- pi+) Meson': 'pi-',\n        'Charm -> (D0 -> ^K+ pi-) Meson': 'pi+'\n    }\n)\n\nThe algorithm is configured with a name MakeD02pipi. In the Code argument we need to specify the initial selection. This is done by using LoKi functors. Since we know we will be using an already prepared selection, we can simply use the DECTREE functor to search for candidates fulfilling this decay structure. See the lesson on LoKi for more info on what you can do here. \nNow we ware ready to specify which hypotheses to change. Substitutions is a dictionary where the keys are decay descriptors and the values are the names of the replacement particles. The particle that should be replaced is marked with a ^. So in the example above\n'Charm -> (D0 -> ^K- pi+) Meson': 'pi-'\n\nmeans: Look for a decay of a Charm-particle into D0 plus any meson, where the D0 decays to (K- pi+) and replace the K- with a pi-.\nNote that SubstitutePID does not automatically handle complex conjugation via the CC operator. Therefore you have to specify all substitutions explicitely. \nNext we have to handle the input and output of this algorithm. This is accomplished using particle selections. The input to our substitution algorithm will be the candidates produced by the stripping. In order to make them look like a selection we can use the DataOnDemand service:\nfrom PhysSelPython.Wrappers import Selection\nfrom PhysSelPython.Wrappers import SelectionSequence\nfrom PhysSelPython.Wrappers import DataOnDemand\n\n# Stream and stripping line we want to use\nstream = 'AllStreams'\nline = 'D2hhCompleteEventPromptDst2D2RSLine'\ntesLoc = '/Event/{0}/Phys/{1}/Particles'.format(stream, line)\n\n# get the selection(s) created by the stripping\nstrippingSels = [DataOnDemand(Location=tesLoc)]\n\nThe output of the algorithm has to be packaged into a new selection:\n# create a selection using the substitution algorithm\nselSub = Selection(\n    'Dst2D0pi_D02pipi_Sel',\n    Algorithm=Subs,\n    RequiredSelections=strippingSels\n)\n\nNote how the input stripping selection is daisy-chained to the output selection through the RequiredSelections (it has to be a list of selections) argument. The new selection is added into a SelectionSequnce for further use by DaVinci:\nselSeq = SelectionSequence('SelSeq', TopSelection=selSub)\n\nWe are now ready to produce an ntuple on our newly created selection. As usual we configure a DecayTreeTuple, which now is looking for the candidates, which have the redefined D0 decay:\n# Create an ntuple to capture D*+ decays from the new selection\ndtt = DecayTreeTuple('TupleDstToD0pi_D0Topipi')\ndtt.Inputs = [selSeq.outputLocation()]\n# note the redefined decay of the D0\ndtt.Decay = '[D*(2010)+ -> ^(D0 -> ^pi- ^pi+) ^pi+]CC'\n\nThe input to the DecayTreeTuple is taken as the outputLocations of the SelectionSequence we just created. \n Why use DaVinci selections?Selections and SelectionSequences are an elegant way to organize the required \nalgorithms that perform the job of selecting data.\nThe particle selection toolkit uses python tricks to make the management of even complicated sequences of selections rather straight forward. In particular the toolkit ensures that all necessary algorithms are run in the correct order to produce the desired selections. It is therfore mainly a tool to manage dependencies. For technical details have a look at the TWiki page.\n\nFinally we add the SelectionSequence and the DecayTreeTuple to the DaVinci application. Since we are adding more than one algorithm we need a GaudiSequencer that takes care of calling everything in the right order:\n# add our new selection and the tuple into the sequencer\nseq = GaudiSequencer('MyTupleSeq')\nseq.Members += [selSeq.sequence()]\nseq.Members += [dtt]\nDaVinci().appendToMainSequence([seq])\n\nThe solution to this exercise ntuple_switchHypo.py, is available \nhere.\n Think about itWhy can't we use this method to look for D* decaying to D0+photon ?

Most commonly, an event is created via the following procedure:\n\nThe ProductionTool (Pythia, GenXicc, ...) generates an event with the required signal particle. Either by generating minimum bias events until a matching particle is found or by ensuring one is produced in every event. The resulting event is comprised of either stable particles or unstable particles which are known to either EvtGen or Geant4 and can be decayed.\nThe signal particle is decayed using the DecayTool (EvtGen) to the desired final state, all remaining unstable particles are decayed independently.\nThe signal and its decay products might be required to pass generator level cuts implemented as a CutTool.\nParticles are transported through the detector simulation.\n\n Things to remember\nThe detector simulation is by far the most time consuming step (minutes, compared to seconds for the rest). So make sure your generator cuts remove events you cannot possibly reconstruct or select later on. Additional options are available to increase the speed, please talk to your MC liaisons!\nThe generator cuts are only applied to the signal that was forced to decay to the specific final state. Any other true signal candidate is not required to pass.\nThe number of generated events refers to the number entering step 4 above, so those passing the generator level cuts. Not the number of events produced by the ProductionTool in the first step.\n\n\nFiguring out which option files to use and how to run Gauss\nImagine you need to know the option files and software versions used for a simulated sample you have found in the bookkeeping, e.g.\n/MC/2015/Beam2510GeV-2015-MagDown-Nu1.5-25ns-Pythia8/Sim09b/Trig0x4115014e/Reco15a/Turbo01aEM/Stripping22NoPrescalingFlagged/27163003/ALLSTREAMS.DST\nFirst, find the ProductionID:\n\nSearch for this ID in the Transformation Monitor, right click the result and select \"Show request\". Right clicking and selecting \"View\" in the new window will open an overview about all the individual steps of the production with their application version and option files used.\n Important: the order of the option files does matter!'$DECFILESROOT/options/27163003.py' '$LBPYTHIA8ROOT/options/Pythia8.py' \nproduces the sample using Pythia 8 while '$LBPYTHIA8ROOT/options/Pythia8.py' \n'$DECFILESROOT/options/27163003.py' uses Pythia 6.\n\nThe production system handles the necessary settings for initial event- and runnumber and the used database tags. In a private production, you need to set these yourself in an additional options file, containing, for example:\nfrom Gauss.Configuration import GenInit\n\nGaussGen = GenInit(\"GaussGen\")\nGaussGen.FirstEventNumber = 1\nGaussGen.RunNumber = 1082\n\nfrom Configurables import LHCbApp\nLHCbApp().DDDBtag = 'dddb-20150724'\nLHCbApp().CondDBtag = 'sim-20160623-vc-md100'\nLHCbApp().EvtMax = 5\n\nAssuming this is saved in a file called Gauss-Job.py and following the example above, the sample can then be produced by running\nlb-run Gauss/v49r7 gaudirun.py '$APPCONFIGOPTS/Gauss/Beam2510GeV-md100-2015-nu1.5.py' \\\n    '$APPCONFIGOPTS/Gauss/DataType-2015.py' \\\n    '$APPCONFIGOPTS/Gauss/RICHRandomHits.py' \\\n    '$DECFILESROOT/options/27163003.py' \\\n    '$LBPYTHIA8ROOT/options/Pythia8.py' \\\n    '$APPCONFIGOPTS/Gauss/G4PL_FTFP_BERT_EmNoCuts.py' \\\n    '$APPCONFIGOPTS/Persistency/Compression-ZLIB-1.py' \\\n    Gauss-Job.py\n\nThis would take 5 to 10 minutes due to the detector simulation, which can be turned off by adding '$GAUSSOPTS/GenStandAlone.py' as one of the option files.\nSetting up a new Decay\nEvtGen is completely controlled via a specific file for each sample, known as a DecFile. Non-signal decays are produced according to DECAY.DEC, which contains all known (measured + some predicted) hadron decays. These live in the DecFiles package\nTo understand what is produced in any simulated sample, you need to understand these. First, how to try them out.\nThe procedure for testing and committing decfiles is well documented on TWiki\nThe TWiki page still uses the old SetupProject approach. Instead, we will adapt this to use the new lb-run and lb-dev approach. First we need to create a Gauss developement environment:\nlb-dev --name GaussDev_ImpactKit Gauss/v49r7\ncd GaussDev_ImpactKit\n\nTo modify or add a dec file, we need the DecFiles package which is still on svn:\ngetpack Gen/DecFiles head\nmake\n\nThis will populate the ./Gen/DecFiles/Options directory with an python options file to generate events for each decfile, (eventtype).py. The location where the dec files are located is stored in $DECFILESROOT and we can check that the correct on is used by running\n./run $SHELL -c 'echo $DECFILESROOT'\n\nwhich should point Gen/DecFiles directory in the current development environment.\n RecompilingNote that recompiling will not overwrite existing options file, it is necessary to remove by hand all of the python files in ./Gen/DecFiles/Options.\n\nAfter this, to produce some generator level events:\n./run gaudirun.py Gauss-Job.py '$GAUSSOPTS/GenStandAlone.py' '$DECFILESROOT/options/11164001.py' '$LBPYTHIA8ROOT/options/Pythia8.py'\n\nThis will output a .xgen file containing simulated events, as well as a root file containing various monitoring histograms you will probably never want to look at.As stated above, note that the number of events produced is after generator level cuts - this is also true for production requests.\nThe .xgen file can be processed into something more usable with DaVinci:\n\"\"\"Configure the variables below with:\ndecay: Decay you want to inspect, using 'newer' LoKi decay descriptor syntax,\ndecay_heads: Particles you'd like to see the decay tree of,\ndatafile: Where the file created by the Gauss generation phase is, and\nyear: What year the MC is simulating.\n\"\"\"\n# https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCb/FAQ/LoKiNewDecayFinders\ndecay = \"[ [B0]cc => ^(D- => ^K+ ^pi- ^pi-) ^pi+]CC\"\ndecay_heads = [\"B0\", \"B~0\"]\ndatafile = \"Gauss-11164001-5ev-20170504.xgen\"# N.B output filename includes today's date - change this!\nyear = 2012\n\n\n\nfrom Configurables import (\n    DaVinci,\n    EventSelector,\n    PrintMCTree,\n    MCDecayTreeTuple\n)\nfrom DecayTreeTuple.Configuration import *\n\n\n# For a quick and dirty check, you don't need to edit anything below here.\n##########################################################################\n\n# Create an MC DTT containing any candidates matching the decay descriptor\nmctuple = MCDecayTreeTuple(\"MCDecayTreeTuple\")\nmctuple.Decay = decay\nmctuple.ToolList = [\n    \"MCTupleToolHierarchy\",\n    \"LoKi::Hybrid::MCTupleTool/LoKi_Photos\"\n]\n# Add a 'number of photons' branch\nmctuple.addTupleTool(\"MCTupleToolKinematic\").Verbose = True\nmctuple.addTupleTool(\"LoKi::Hybrid::TupleTool/LoKi_Photos\").Variables = {\n    \"nPhotos\": \"MCNINTREE(('gamma' == MCABSID))\"\n}\n\n# Print the decay tree for any particle in decay_heads\nprintMC = PrintMCTree()\nprintMC.ParticleNames = decay_heads\n\n# Name of the .xgen file produced by Gauss\nEventSelector().Input = [\"DATAFILE='{0}' TYP='POOL_ROOTTREE' Opt='READ'\".format(datafile)]\n\n# Configure DaVinci\nDaVinci().TupleFile = \"DVntuple.root\"\nDaVinci().Simulation = True\nDaVinci().Lumi = False\nDaVinci().DataType = str(year)\nDaVinci().UserAlgorithms = [printMC, mctuple]\n\nlb-run DaVinci/v41r0 gaudirun.py DaVinciOptions.py\n\nThis script will attempt to build an nTuple from the xgen file it is given, using the specified decay descriptor.

Note that once MC has been produced from a given DecFile, it is not allowed to be changed, so you never need to worry about which version of DecFiles you are looking at when trying to understand existing samples.\nThe \"Cuts\" field specifies which one of a predetermined set of cut tools are used. The best way to understand these is to look at the source code:\nhttps://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb/Gauss/blob/master/Gen/GenCuts/\nGenerator level cuts\nDetector simulation is computationally expensive, and event generation is comparatively fast. Cuts at generator level save a huge amount of CPU and disk space (which means you can have more actually useful events) almost for free. At generator level you can only cut on pre-resolution quantities, so normally you want the generator cuts to be 100% efficient for selected events (within epsilon). The default example is to immediately remove events where the daughters are far outside the LHCb acceptance.\nThis is implemented in \"DaugthersInLHCb\", aka \"DecProdCut\" in the NickName. This requires that each \"stable charged particle\" is in a loose region around the LHCb acceptance (10-400 mrad in Theta). \nLoKi GenCutTool\nAnother method to apply generator level cuts is via the LoKi::GenCutTool.

Therefore, a filtering of the final candidates obtained after the stripping step in the MC production can be applied. As this does not reduce the CPU requirements, filtering steps are best accompanied by a matching (but looser) set of generator cuts.\nAssuming we have a sample of simulated D*+ -> D0( -> K pi ) pi which we would like to filter on the Turbo line 'Hlt2CharmHadD02KPi_XSecTurbo':\nfrom GaudiConf import IOHelper\nIOHelper().inputFiles(\n   ['root://eoslhcb.cern.ch//eos/lhcb/grid/prod/lhcb/MC/2015/ALLSTREAMS.DST/00057933/0000/00057933_00000232_3.AllStreams.dst'],\n    clear=True)\n\nWe also do not need any events where the D0 candidate has a transverse momentum less than 3 GeV.

The necessary configuration is basically identical in all filtering options in use and for the DST format reads\nfrom DSTWriters.Configuration import (SelDSTWriter, stripDSTStreamConf, stripDSTElements)\n\nSelDSTWriterElements = {'default': stripDSTElements()}\nSelDSTWriterConf = {'default': stripDSTStreamConf()}\n\ndstWriter = SelDSTWriter(\"TurboFiltered\",\n                         StreamConf=SelDSTWriterConf,\n                         MicroDSTElements=SelDSTWriterElements,\n                         OutputFileSuffix ='',\n                         SelectionSequences=[selseq]  # Only events passing selseq are written out!\n\nfrom Configurables import DaVinci\nDaVinci().appendToMainSequence([dstWriter.sequence()])\n\nRunning these options (after adding the usual DaVinci() options like data type, tags etc) produces the file SelD0_Filtered.dst and you can verify that every event has a candidate passing 'Hlt2CharmHadD02KPi_XSecTurbo' with at least 3 GeV transverse momentum.\n Filtering in production\nOption files need to be tested and checked by the MC liaisons.\nExist in the WG project: Lots and lots of examples.\nMore details and naming conventions on TWiki\n\n\n"},"second-analysis-steps/hlt-intro.html":{"url":"second-analysis-steps/hlt-intro.html","title":"HLT intro","keywords":"","body":"HLT intro\n Learning Objectives\nLearn about the LHCb trigger.\nLearn how to run Moore from settings and from TCK.\nGetting started with writing your own trigger selection.\n\n \nThe LHCb trigger reduces the input rate event rate of approximately 30 MHz\nto 12.5 kHz of events that are written to offline tape storage. The rate\nreduction is achieved in three steps: L0, HLT1 and HLT2. L0 is implemented in\ncustom FPGAs, has a fixed latency of 4 μs and a maximum output rate of 1 MHz.\nHLT stands for High Level Trigger.\nHLT1 and HLT2 are implemented as software applications that run on the online\nfarm; HLT1 runs in real-time and writes events to the local harddrives of the\nfarm machines, while HLT2 uses the rest of the available CPU (100% when there is\nno beam) to process the events written by HLT1. The evolution of the disk buffer is\nshown in the figure below. Events accepted by HLT2 are sent to offline storage.\n\nIn Run I, both the reconstructions and selections used by HLT1, HLT2 and offline\nwere very different. In Run 2 the reconstructions used in HLT2 and offline are\nidentical, while selections might still be different. To be fast, HLT1 runs a subset\nof the HLT2 reconstruction, for example HLT1 provides only tracks with PT > 500 MeV\nand only Muon particle identification. We will see the difference in speed in the following. \nA new feature in Run 2 is the so-called Turbo stream. Since the reconstruction\navailable in HLT2 is the same as the offline reconstruction, physics analyses\ncan be done with the candidates created in HLT2. If a line is configured to be a\nTurbo line, all information on the candidates that it selects is stored in the\nraw event. The rest of the raw event, like sub-detector raw banks, is discarded,\nand cannot be recovered offline. The advantage of the Turbo stream is that\nless data are written to tape and no CPU intensive offline processing is needed.\nThe application of the software trigger is called Moore. Moore relies on the same\nalgorithms as are used in Brunel to run the reconstruction and in DaVinci to\nselect particle decays.\nRun Moore from settings\nLet's start with a simple Moore script, we call it runMoore.py:\nfrom Configurables import Moore\n# Define settings\nMoore().ThresholdSettings = \"Physics_pp_2017\"\nMoore().RemoveInputHltRawBanks = True\nMoore().Split = ''\n# A bit more output\nfrom Gaudi.Configuration import INFO\nMoore().EnableTimer = True\nMoore().OutputLevel = INFO\n# Input data\nfrom PRConfig import TestFileDB\n# The following call configures input data, database tags and data type\nTestFileDB.test_file_db[\"2016NB_25ns_L0Filt0x1609\"].run(configurable=Moore())\nMoore().DataType = \"2017\"\n# Override the TCK in the ThresholdSettings to match the input data\nfrom Configurables import HltConf\nHltConf().setProp(\"L0TCK\", '0x1609')\n# Remove a line which accepts every event when run on this sample\nHltConf().RemoveHlt1Lines = [\"Hlt1MBNoBias\"]\n\nMoore().EvtMax = 1000\nprint Moore()\n\nTry to run it with\n$ lb-run Moore/latest gaudirun.py runMoore.py | tee log.txt\nThe property split defines if HLT1, HLT2 or both are run. In the example above both are run.\nChange Moore().Split to 'Hlt1' and rerun.\nTo run HLT2 only, you have to change some settings and the input file has to be a file where\nHLT1 has run on:\n...\nMoore().RemoveInputHltRawBanks = False # Why?\nMoore().Split = 'Hlt2'\n...\nTestFileDB.test_file_db[\"2016_Hlt1_0x11361609\"].run(configurable=Moore())\n...\n\nNote: HLT2 needs to know about the decisions of trigger lines used in HLT1.\nThe decisions are decoded from the definitions in the HLT1 TCK. Therefore, HLT2 can only\nread data which have been created when running Moore from TCK and not from settings.\n Compare Hlt1 and Hlt2What is reduction factor of Hlt1? (Search how many events are accepted by Hlt1Global.)\nWhat is reduction factor of Hlt2? (Search how many events are accepted by Hlt2Global.)\nWhat is difference in run time of Hlt1 and Hlt2?\n\nRun Moore from TCK*\nThere are two ways to run Moore, from ThresholdSettings and from TCK (Trigger Configuration Key).\nWhen you develop a trigger line, it is more convenient to run from ThresholdSettings. The TCK\nis used when running the trigger on the online farm or in MC productions as it uniquely defines the settings.\n What is a TCK?The Trigger Configuration Key (TCK) stores the configuration of the HLT in a \ndatabase.\nAll algorithms and their properties are defined in it.\nThe key is usually given as a hexadecimal number. The last 4 digits define the L0 TCK.\nThe first 4 digits define the HLT configuration. HLT1 TCKs start with 1, HLT2 TCKs start\nwith 2.\n\nRunning from TCK has a few restrictions:\n 1 The L0TCK defined in the TCK and the one in data have to match.\n 2 The HltTCK might be incompatible with a Moore version if the properties of C++ algorithms changed.    \nHere is an example script to run from an Hlt1 TCK.\nfrom Configurables import Moore\n# Define settings\nMoore().UseTCK = True\n# You can check in TCKsh which TCKs exist and for which Moore versions they can be used.\nMoore().InitialTCK = \"0x11381609\"\nMoore().Split = 'Hlt1'\nMoore().RemoveInputHltRawBanks = True\n# In the online farm Moore checks if the TCK in data and the configuration are the same.\n# Here we disable it as we run a different TCK.\nMoore().CheckOdin = False\nMoore().outputFile = \"TestTCK1.mdf\"\n# A bit more output\nfrom Gaudi.Configuration import INFO\nMoore().EnableTimer = True\nMoore().OutputLevel = INFO\n# Input data\nfrom PRConfig import TestFileDB\nTestFileDB.test_file_db[\"2016NB_25ns_L0Filt0x1609\"].run(configurable=Moore())\nMoore().DataType = \"2016\"\nMoore().EvtMax = 1000\nprint Moore()\n\nRun with\n$ lb-run Moore/v25r4 gaudirun.py runMoore_hlt1_tck.py | tee log_hlt1_tck.txt\nTo run HLT2 on the output data of the first stage, use the following script:\nfrom Configurables import Moore\n# Define settings\nMoore().UseTCK = True\nMoore().InitialTCK = \"0x21381609\"\nMoore().DataType = \"2016\"\nMoore().Split = 'Hlt2'\nMoore().RemoveInputHltRawBanks = False\nMoore().CheckOdin = False\nMoore().EnableOutputStreaming = True\nMoore().outputFile = \"TestTCK2.mdf\"\n# A bit more output\nfrom Gaudi.Configuration import INFO\nMoore().EnableTimer = True\nMoore().OutputLevel = INFO\n# Input data\nMoore().DDDBtag = 'dddb-20150724'\nMoore().CondDBtag = 'cond-20170325'\nMoore().inputFiles = [\"TestTCK1.mdf\"]\nMoore().EvtMax = 100\n\nExploring a TCK\nIf you are interested in how to create a TCK, you can follow the instructions\ngiven here.\nTo get a list of all available TCKs one can use TCKsh which is a python shell with predefined\nfunctions to explore TCKs, do\n$ lb-run Moore/latest TCKsh  \n> listConfigurations()\nThere are other useful commands like listHlt1Lines() or listHlt2Lines().\nMore advanced is to search for properties of a line. One example is to search for the prescale.\nThe prescale determines how often a line is executed, 1.0 means always, 0.0 never.\nType for example:\n> listProperties(0x214a160f,\".*Hlt2DiMuonJPsi.*\",\"AcceptFraction\")\n...\n> listProperties(0x214a160f,\".*Hlt2DiMuonJPsiPreScaler.*\",\"AcceptFraction\")\n Compare HLT1 lines from Run1 and Run2Try to find out which HLT1 lines were available in Run 1 and which are now available in Run 2.\nWhat are the names of the topological trigger lines in Run 1 and Run 2?\n\nWrite your own HLT2 trigger line or adapt an existing one\nHLT2 lines are similar to stripping lines. They combine basic particles to composite objects\nand you apply selections to get a clean sample. The framework in which you write a trigger\nline looks different to a stripping line but the underlying algorithms are the same.\nDocumentation is found here.\nThere you also find information how to measure the efficiency or the output rate of a trigger line.\nHLT2 lines are found in the Hlt gitlab project in the package Hlt2Lines, see here.\nTheir settings, i.e. the cut definitions, have to be defined in HltSettings package as well,\nsee here.\nAs a hands on, we will change the prescale of a line with a high rate and then reduce its rate with extra cuts.\nFirst setup a Moore lb-dev project from the nightlies.\n$ lb-dev --nightly-cvmfs --nightly lhcb-head Moore/HEAD\n$ cd MooreDev_HEAD\n$ git lb-use Hlt\n$ git lb-checkout Hlt/master Hlt/HltSettings\n$ git lb-checkout Hlt/master Hlt/Hlt2Lines\n$ make\nGo to Hlt/HltSettings/python/HltSettings/DiMuon/DiMuon_pp_2017.py, search for prescale and change the prescale of Hlt2DiMuonJPsi to 1.0.\nRun Moore again and see if the rate of this line has increased.\nThe line is defined in Hlt/Hlt2Lines/python/Hlt2Lines/DiMuon/Lines.py. The cut properties appear in the dictionary under JPsi.\nAdd an entry with the key MinProbNN and set some value. If you search for JPsi in the file, you will find that the lines\nuses JpsiFilter from Stages.py. As it is used by another line as well, you have to add the entry to JPsiHighPT as well.\nJpsiFilter simply uses muon pairs as input.  Go to Stages.py  and adapt the code of the Hlt2ParticleFilter to filter on the\npid of the muons, to do that add (MINTREE('mu-' == ABSID, PROBNNmu) > %(MinProbNN)s )\nto the cut string. Run Moore again and see if the rate of this line has now decreased.\nFor more complicated developments which require changing many files or concurrent development of several people,\nwe encourage to use a full checkout of the Moore and Hlt projects and to use vanilla git commands.\nA user friendly setup for this is being developed under the name trigger-dev.\nWe encourage people to check it out and give feedback on the issues page.\n Convert a stripping line to a Hlt2 line\nPick a stripping line and convert it to a HLT2 line.\nMake it a Turbo line.\nRun a rate test to determine the rate of the line.\n\n\n"},"second-analysis-steps/tistos-diy.html":{"url":"second-analysis-steps/tistos-diy.html","title":"TisTos DIY","keywords":"","body":"TisTos DIY\n Learning Objectives\nLearn what TisTos is and why it's useful\nUse an interactive python session to look at TisTos on a local DST\n\n \nOnce HLT1 or HLT2 has accepted an event, the candidates accepted by all trigger\nlines are saved to the raw event in a stripped-down form. One of the things that\nis saved are all the LHCbIDs of the final state particles of a decay tree.\n What is an LHCbID?Every single sub-detector element has an LHCbID which is unique across the \nwhole detector.\nPhysics objects, such as tracks, can be defined as sets of LHCbID objects.\nWhen a trigger decision is made, the set of LHCbID objects which comprise the triggering\nobject is stored in the SelReports. This allows objects reconstructed later, such as in Brunel,\nto be compared with the objects reconstructed in the trigger.\n\nA new feature in Run 2 is the so-called Turbo stream. Since the reconstruction\navailable in HLT2 is the same as the offline reconstruction, physics analysis\ncan be done with the candidates created in HLT2. If a line is configured to be a\nTurbo line, all information on the candidates that it selects is stored in the\nraw event. These candidates can be resurrected later by the Tesla application and\nwritten to a microDST. This is similar to stripping streams that go to \nmicroDST, where only candidates that are used in passing selections are \navailable to analysts. The Turbo stream is different because information that \nis not saved is lost forever.\nWe will now have a look at some of the candidates stored by the HLT. We will use the script we\nused last time\nas a starting point, and the file\nroot://eoslhcb.cern.ch//eos/lhcb/user/r/raaij/Impactkit/00051318_00000509_1.turbo.mdst.\nThis file contains some 2016 Turbo events from run \n174252.  Fire up your\nfavourite editor, open the script and save a copy to work on as\nhlt_info.py. There are a few things in the script that we don't need and can\nbe removed, such as the print_decay method and the decay finder tools.\nLike the stripping, the decisions of the HLT are saved in so-called\nDecReports. You can find them in Hlt1/DecReports and Hlt2/DecReports, have a\nlook at what they contain.\nevt['Hlt1/DecReports']\nevt['Hlt2/DecReports']\n\nAn important difference with the stripping is that for the HLT, all the\ndecisions are present, even if they are false. Copy the advance function to\nadvance_hlt, make it work on HLT decisions and make sure it really checks the\ndecision. This can be done using the decision member function of a\nDecReport. Note that all names in the reports end with Decision.\nreports = evt['Hlt1/DecReports']\nreport = reports.decReport('Hlt1TrackAllL0Decision')\nprint report.decision()\n\nThe HLT1 selections that are most efficient for hadronic charm and beauty decays\nin Run 2 are called Hlt1TrackMVA and Hlt1TwoTrackMVA. Use the advance function\nto find an event that was accepted by either of these trigger selections.\nThe DecReports only contains the decisions for each line, 1 or 0. The \ncandidates themselves are stored in the\nSelReports (\"Hlt{1,2}/SelReports\"). Get the HLT1 SelReports from the event store\nand retrieve the one for one of the TrackMVA selections using the selReport function,\nanalogously to how the DecReport was retrieved above.\nThe SelReports store candidates in a tree of sub-structures, which can be\naccessed using the substructure member funtion of a report. Any SelReport has at\nleast one level of sub-structure. The sub-structure is internally stored in\nSmartRefs, which can be dereferenced using their \"data\" method. Let's have a look\nat a SelReport for a TrackMVA selection.\nreports = evt['Hlt1/SelReports']\nreport = reports.selReport('Hlt1TrackMVADecision')\nprint report\nreport.substructure().size()\nreport.substructure()[0].substructure().size()\nreport.substructure()[0].substructure()[0]\nreport.substructure()[0].substructure()[0].data()\n\nIn addition to the LHCbIDs, some numbers are also stored, such as the momentum\nof the track. These are stored in the numerical info dictionary that can be\nretrieved using:\nreport.substructure()[0].substructure()[0].numericalInfo()\n\n Plot the transverse momentum distributionMake a plot of the total and transverse moment distributions of all candidates\naccepted by the Hlt1TrackMVA selection. Then add Hlt1TwoTrackMVA and\nconsider the difference.\n\nThe LHCbIDs of the (in this case) track can be retrieved using:\nreport.substructure()[0].substructure()[0].lhcbIDs()\n\n Turbo candidatesNow let's have a look at the same information that is stored for a candidate\ncreated by a Turbo line, for example Hlt2CharmHadDsp2KS0PimPipPip_KS0LLTurbo.\nAdapt the advance_hlt with an additional argument that allows specification\nof the location of DecReports it uses, then advance to an event that was selected by\nHlt2CharmHadDsp2KS0PimPipPip_KS0LLTurbo, retrieve its SelReport and have a\nlook at what's stored.\n\nThe LHCbIDs of the final state particles of the candidate that was created\noffline (in the stripping or by your script) can be compared to those saved by\nthe HLT to find out if the offline candidate was accepted by the trigger. The\nclassification that results from this comparison is called TisTos (Trigger\nindependent of Signal/Trigger on Signal).\nAn offline candidate is considered to be Tos with respect to a trigger selection\nif it was accepted by that trigger selection. In more formal terms, if the\nLHCbIDs of each of the final state particles of the candidate accepted by the\ntrigger selection overlap for more than 70% with the LHCbIDs of final state\nparticles of the offline candidate.\nFor example, the Hlt1TrackAllL0 line accepts an event if there is at least one\ntrack with a lot of PT and a large IPCHI2. If any of the tracks accepted by the\nHlt1TrackAllL0 line overlap for more than 70% with one of the tracks of the\noffline candidate, it is Tos with respect to Hlt1TrackAllL0. If\nHlt1DiMuonHighMass is considered instead, then the LHCbIDs of both tracks that\nmake-up the Hlt1DiMuonHighMass candidates must overlap with the LHCbIDs of two\ntracks that are part of the offline candidate.\nTo have a look at how this works, we'll use candidates from the\nD2hhPromptDst2D2RS selection, which can be retrieved thusly:\ncandidates = evt['AllStreams/Phys/D2hhPromptDst2D2RSLine/Particles']\ncandidates.size()\n\nIt could be that there are more than one candidates, which are unlikely to all be\nreal. MC matching could be used to find the real one when running on\nsimulation and on data a single candidate can be selected, either randomly or\nusing some criterium. Dealing with multiple candidates correctly is beyond the\nscope of this tutorial, so just always take the first one in the container.\nLet's use the TriggerTisTos tool now. In preparation for Run-II, the Hlt1 and\nHlt2 DecReports and SelReports are now stored in different locations. That means\ntwo TisTos tools will be needed, each configured to pick up information from\neither HLT1 or HLT2. Since the tools we create are public tools, they have to be\nconfigured in the following way (before the AppMgr is instantiated):\nfrom Configurables import ToolSvc, TriggerTisTos\nToolSvc().addTool(TriggerTisTos, \"Hlt1TriggerTisTos\")\nToolSvc().Hlt1TriggerTisTos.HltDecReportsLocation = 'Hlt1/DecReports'\nToolSvc().Hlt1TriggerTisTos.HltSelReportsLocation = 'Hlt1/SelReports'\n\nCreate the tools in the same way you created others during the\nother lesson, but use instance-specific names that\ncorrespond to the configuration we just added: Hlt1TriggerTisTos and\nHlt2TriggerTisTos. The tools use ITriggerTisTos as an interface.\nUse the advance function to find an event that has some candidates for the\nchosen selection and set the TisTos tools to use our candidate and trigger selection:\nhlt1TisTosTool.setOfflineInput()\ncandidate = candidates[0]\nhlt1TisTosTool.addToOfflineInput(candidate)\nhlt1TisTosTool.setTriggerInput()\nhlt1TisTosTool.addToTriggerInput(\"Hlt1TrackAllL0Decision\")\nresult = hlt1TisTosTool.tisTosTobTrigger()\nresult.tos()\n\nThe set calls reset the internal storage of candidate or trigger information,\nand the addTo calls then add the things we are interested in.\nAn offline candidate is considered to be Tis with respect to a trigger selection\nif removing it from the event would still cause the trigger selection to accept\nthe event, i.e. if there is another particle in the event that was also\naccepted by the trigger selection. In more formal terms, if the LHCbIDs of the\nall of the final state particles of any of the candidates accepted by the\ntrigger selection overlap less than 1% with all of the LHCbIDs of the final\nstate particles of the offline candidate.\nresult.tis()\n\nNote that a candidate can be both Tis and Tos with respect to a trigger\nselection, or Tos with respect to one selection, and Tis with respect to\nanother. To tell the tool to consider more trigger selections, use the following\n(regexes are also supported), and try to find some events that are both Tos and\nTis:\nhlt1TisTosTool.setTriggerInput()\nhlt1TisTosTool.addToTriggerInput(\"Hlt1TrackAllL0Decision\")\nhlt1TisTosTool.addToTriggerInput(\"Hlt1DiMuonHighMassDecision\")\nresult = hlt1TisTosTool.tisTosTobTrigger()\n\nThe (Tos) trigger efficiency of a trigger selection can be calculated as:\n$$\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{Tos}}=N_{\\mathrm{Tis}\\&\\mathrm{Tos}} / {N_{\\mathrm{Tis}}}$$\nLoop over the events in the DST and calculate the efficiency of\nHlt1TrackAllL0. You can add some more Hlt1 selecitons when checking for Tis,\nwhich ones would make sense?\nThere is a third classification, which is called Tob. This is the case if the\noverlap — as defined for Tis and Tos — is between 1% and 70%.\nTo determine if a candidate is a combination of Tis, Tos and Tob or none of\nthese, an LHCb software tool has been created that calculates the overlaps and\nclassifies candidates with respect to trigger selection. This tool is called\nTriggerTisTos and it implements the ITriggerTisTos interface.\n"},"second-analysis-steps/ganga-scripting.html":{"url":"second-analysis-steps/ganga-scripting.html","title":"Ganga Scripting","keywords":"","body":"Scripting Ganga\nWe have already started using Ganga, such as when submitting jobs to the \nGrid and \nusing datasets from the \nbookkeeping when \ncreating jobs, but there's a lot more you can do with it.\nPart of Ganga's power come from it being written in Python. When you run \nganga, you're given an IPython prompt where you input Python code that's executed when you hit .\nThe idea of running Python code extends outside of Ganga, where we can write\nscripts that Ganga will execute when starting up. This lesson will focus on\nwriting job definition scripts, and exploring how we can define utility\nfunctions that will be available across all of our Ganga sessions.\nDefining jobs with scripts\nThe ganga executable is similar to the python and ipython executables in \na couple of ways.\nIf you just run ganga, your dropped into a prompt, but you can also supply \nthe path to a Python script that will be executed.\nLet's start with a small script, saving it in a file called create_job.py:\ngreeting = 'Hello!'\nprint greeting\n\nRun it:\n$ ganga create_job.py\n\n*** Welcome to Ganga ***\nVersion: 6.5.1\n…\nHello!\n…\n\nSensible enough. Just like python and ipython, we can pass the -i flag \nbefore the file path to tell Ganga to give us a prompt after it's finished \nexecuting the script:\n$ ganga -i create_job.py\n\n*** Welcome to Ganga ***\nVersion: 6.5.1\n…\nHello!\n\nGanga In [1]: greeting\nGanga Out [1]: 'Hello!'\n\nGanga In [2]:\n\nNotice that the variable we defined in the script, greeting, is available in \nthe interactive session.\nThe idea of doing some work in a script and then manipulating the result \ninteractively can be quite powerful.\nOne workflow that you might find useful is to create a script that defines a \njob, because this can often take a few lines to do, and typing them out every \ntime is boring.\nLet's modify create_job.py to do that.\n# Note: Ganga makes objects like `Job` available in your script automagically\nj = Job()\nj.name = 'My job'\n\nThis example is quite boring, but it captures the idea. You'll want to\nextend this, changing the application property to a GaudiExec instance,\nfor example, as covered in a previous\nlesson.\nNow we can run this and interact with the job as the j variable:\n$ ganga -i create_job.py\n\n*** Welcome to Ganga ***\nVersion: 6.5.1\n…\n\nGanga In [1]: j\nGanga Out [1]:\nJob (\n  comment = ,\n  parallel_submit = False,\n  …\n)\n\nGanga In [2]:\n\nWe often want to construct a set of very similar jobs that differ only by their \ninput data, for example running the same DaVinci application over 2015 and 2016 \ndata and for magnet up and magnet down configurations.\nWe need to then parameterise our script, and one way of doing this is passing \narguments to it by the command line.\nYou can inspect arguments from a Python script by using the argv \nproperty on the sys module:\nimport sys\nprint sys.argv\n\nAdd that to your create_job.py script, and run ganga again, this time \npassing some arguments:\n$ ganga -i create_job.py -v 123 --hello=world\n\n*** Welcome to Ganga ***\nVersion: 6.5.1\n…\n\n['create_job.py', '-v', '123', '--hello=world']\n\nGanga In [1]: j\n\nOur script sees sys.argv as the list of the arguments that come after ganga \n-i.\nTo parameterise our script for year and magnet polarity, we could check this \nlist to find one of 2015 or 2016 and one of Up or Down, for example, \nbut instead we'll opt to use the excellent argparse module, which \ncomes with Python, to parse the command-line arguments for us.\nimport argparse\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"Make my DaVinci job.\")\nparser.add_argument('year', type=int, choices=[2015, 2016],\n                    help='Year of data-taking to run over')\nparser.add_argument('polarity', choices=['Up', 'Down'],\n                    help='Polarity of data-taking to run over')\nparser.add_argument('--test', action='store_true',\n                    help='Run over one file locally')\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n\nyear = args.year\npolarity = args.polarity\ntest = args.test\n\nNicely, argparse gives us a useful --help argument for free:\n$ ganga -i create_job.py --help\n\n*** Welcome to Ganga ***\nVersion: 6.5.1\n…\nusage: create_job.py [-h] [--test] {2015,2016} {Up,Down}\n\nMake my DaVinci job.\n\npositional arguments:\n  {2015,2016}  Year of data-taking to run over\n  {Up,Down}    Polarity of data-taking to run over\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help   show this help message and exit\n  --test       Run over one file locally\n\nGanga In [1]:\n\nThis help will also be printed if we don't supply all of the required arguments \n(the year and the magnet polarity), along with a message telling us what's \nmissing.\n Getting to grips with `argparse`The argparse module can do a lot, being able to parse complex sets of \narguments with much difficultly. It's a useful tool to know in general, so we \nrecommend that you check out the [documentation][argparse] to learn more.\n\nWhen we do supply all the necessary arguments, the values are then available in\nthe year, polarity, and test variables:\n$ ganga -i create_job.py 2015 Down\n\n*** Welcome to Ganga ***\nVersion: 6.5.1\n…\n\nGanga In [1]: print year, polarity, test\n2015 Down False\n\nOnce you've reached this level, a whole world of possibilities opens up! Here \nare a few things you might proceed to do with these parameters in your script:\n\nFetch the corresponding dataset using a BKQuery;\nGive your Job object a specific name, e.g. j.name = \n'Ntuples_{0}_{1}.format(year, polarity)';\nGive data-specific options files to the application object, e.g. if you \nhave one options file per year defining DaVinci().DataType.\n\nOf course, you can add as many arguments as you think might be useful.\nAbove we added the --test flag as an example: if this is True, you could \nrun the application over only a single data file, and run the job locally \nrather than on the Grid (setting j.backend appropriately).\nAdding helpers functions\nWe've seen above how giving a script to ganga makes the variables defined in \nthose scripts available interactively.\nBut what if you have, or would like to have, some set of your own custom helper \nmethods defined in every session? It would be annoying to have to run ganga \nmy_helpers.py every time! Luckily, the ganga.py file comes to the rescue.\nWhen Ganga starts, it looks for a file in your home directory (echo $HOME) \ncalled .ganga.py (note the starting period in the filename). If it finds such \na file, it executes it in the context of the Ganga session, meaning the code in \nthe file has access to Ganga objects like Job, jobs, and so on.\nTo demonstrate the behaviour, we can put a print statement on our \n~/.ganga.py file:\nprint 'Yo!'\n\nThen run ganga (no arguments needed):\n$ ganga\n\n*** Welcome to Ganga ***\nVersion: 6.5.1\n…\nYo!\n…\n\nNeat. The general idea for this file is two-fold:\n\nAdd commands that you always want executed when Ganga starts, e.g. print \njobs.select(status='running'); and\nDefine functions for commonly-performed tasks.\n\nThe latter is particularly interesting. Do you often find yourself creating a \nfile that contains all the output LFNs of your job? Write a helper!\ndef write_lfns(job, filename):\n    \"\"\"Write LFNs of all DiracFiles of all completed subjobs to fname.\"\"\"\n    # Treat a job with subjobs the same as a job with no subjobs\n    jobs = j.subjobs\n    if len(jobs) == 0:\n        jobs = [job]\n\n    lfns = []\n    for j in jobs:\n        if j.status != 'completed':\n            print 'Skipping #{0}'.format(j.id)\n            continue\n        for df in j.outputfiles.get(DiracFile):\n            lfns.append(df.lfn)\n\n    with open(filename, 'w') as f:\n        f.writelfns('\\n'.join(lfns))\n\nHow about downloading and merging the ROOT output of a job's subjobs? Write a helper!\ndef merge_root_output(job, input_tree_name, merged_filepath):\n    # Treat a job with subjobs the same as a job with no subjobs\n    jobs = j.subjobs\n    if len(jobs) == 0:\n        jobs = [job]\n\n    access_urls = []\n    for j in jobs:\n        if j.status != 'completed':\n            print 'Skipping #{0}'.format(j.id)\n            continue\n        for df in j.outputfiles.get(DiracFile):\n            access_urls.append(df.accessURL())\n\n    tchain = ROOT.TChain(input_tree_name)\n    for url in access_urls:\n        tchain.Add(url)\n    tchain.Merge(merged_filepath)\n\nBecause of the way a ROOT TChain works, the subjobs output won't be \ndownloaded, so you only need enough disk space for the merged file.\n Using ROOT in GangaBy default, ROOT is not available in a Ganga session:\nGanga In [1]: import ROOT\nERROR    No module named ROOT\n\nTo remedy this, you can start Ganga inside an environment where ROOT is \navailable:\n$ lb-run ROOT ganga\n\n\nOnce you have your helpers defined, use them in Ganga as you would any other Python function.\nGanga In [1]: j = jobs(123)\n\nGanga In [2]: write_lfns(j, '{0}.lfns'.format(j.name))\n\nHere are some other common operations that you might want helpers for:\n\nDeleting all LFNs created by a job;\nResetting the backend of all subjobs which are marked as failed;\nReplicating all LFNs to a specific Grid site.\n\nWhat other tasks can you think of?\n"},"second-analysis-steps/managing-files-with-ganga.html":{"url":"second-analysis-steps/managing-files-with-ganga.html","title":"Managing files in Ganga","keywords":"","body":"Managing files in Ganga\n Learning Objectives\nChoose whether job output is saved locally or on the Grid\nChoose where to look for job input files\nMove files from any grid site to CERN, for analysis using EOS\n\n \n\nGanga allows you to define a job and have it run anywhere: on your local machine, \non the batch system, or on the Grid.\nThis is very convenient as you don't need to worry about the specifics of each\nplatform.\nGanga treats files in a similar way to jobs, in that you only need to change\nthe object you're using to tell Ganga to use local files, files on the Grid, or\nfiles on EOS.\nIn this lesson, we'll see how you can efficiently manage input and output files\nusing Ganga.\n Ganga problemsGanga is currently in a state of flux. It is changing regularly, and some\nthings may begin or stop work between releases. The developers of Ganga are\nworking to stabilise the application and its interface. This takes some time,\nand it helps to have users report the problems they see.\nIt's generally advised to use the latest available version of Ganga. If you\nencounter problems, you should first search [the archives of the\nlhcb-distributed-analysis mailing list][da-archive]. If you don't find an\nanswer, you can talk to the Ganga developers directly on the [GitHub issues\npage for Ganga][ganga-issues], or by sending an email to\nlhcb-distributed-analysis.\n\n Making a fresh startThroughout this lesson, we'll be using the most up-to-date version of Ganga \nthat's available, v602r2.\nTo make sure there will be no files from older versions of Ganga to interfere, \nwe will move them to a backup location.\n$ cd ~\n$ mkdir ganga-backup\n# See what's in your home directory that's related to Ganga\n$ ls -la | grep -i ganga\n# Then move everything\n$ mv gangadir .gangarc* .ganga.log .ganga.py .ipython-ganga ganga-backup\n\nYou can move this back after the lesson if you want to restore your old \nsettings and data.\n\nWe'll be doing everything in Ganga, so let's start it up.\n$ lb-run Ganga v602r2 ganga\n\nIf it's your first time starting Ganga, you'll be asked if you want to create a \ndefault .gangarc file with the default settings.\n\nWould you like to create default config file ~/.gangarc with standard \nsettings ([y]/n) ?\n\nAnswer with y. The .gangarc file defines the configuration of Ganga, and \nthe defaults are normally good enough.\nYou'll then be dropped in a IPython shell.\nWe will create a job that runs a Python script that accepts a path to an input \ntext file as an argument, and saves a file that contains the text of the file \nreversed. For example, it would save a file containing ‘!dlrow olleH’ if it was \ngiven a file containing ‘Hello world!’ as input.\nDownload the script to lxplus and set it to be executable. \nYou can execute these commands inside Ganga, if you like, by prefixing them \nwith a !.\n$ wget https://lhcb.github.io/second-analysis-steps/code/01-managing-files-with-ganga/reverse.py\n$ chmod +x reverse.py\n$ ./reverse.py\nUsage: reverse.py \n\nIn Ganga, create a Job object with a descriptive name and take a look at it.\nj = Job(name='Reverser')\nprint j\n\nYou'll see that Ganga has created a Job which will execute the echo \ncommand, passing the list of arguments ['Hello World']. Each element of this \nlist will be passed as a positional argument to the echo command.\nWe'll replace the command name and the arguments, so that our reverse.py \nscript is run with a text file as input.\nj.application.exe = File('reverse.py')\nj.application.args = [File('input.txt')]\n\nWe haven't made input.txt, so let's make it by executing a couple of shell \ncommands inside Ganga.\n!echo -e 'Hello world!\\nThis is the second line.' > input.txt\n!cat input.txt\n\nBefore submission, we just need to tell Ganga what to do with the output. The \nscript saves the output to a file called like the input, but with -reversed \nappended before the file extension (.txt in this case), so we tell Ganga \nexplicitly to move this file to the local job output directory.\nj.outputfiles = [LocalFile('input-reversed.txt')]\n\nNow we can submit the job.\nj.submit()\n\nBy default, jobs run on the machine you're running Ganga on, as their backend \nproperty is set to an instance of the Local backend.\nThe job will finish very quickly, and we can inspect the output files.\nj.peek()\nj.peek('input-reversed.txt')\n\nThere are a couple of file-related things to take note of in what we just did:\n\nThe File object is used to define local files that should be available in \nthe ‘working directory’ of the job (wherever it executes). We need both the \nscript and the input text file to be in the working directory, so both of \nthe paths to the files on our local machine are wrapped in File.\nThe LocalFile object is used to define what files in the working directory \nof the job should be saved in the local job output directory, in this case \nthe file with -reversed in it.\n\nNote that there are several files in the job output directory, seen with \nj.peek(), that we didn't explicitly ask for, most notably stdout and \nstderr. These two files are essentially the logs of the job, and Ganga always \nsaves them in the local job output directory as they're almost always useful.For Gaudi jobs, Ganga will also automatically download the summary.xml file, \nwhich contains useful information about algorithm counters.\ndf = DiracFile('input.txt', localDir='.')\ndf.put(uploadSE='CERN-USER')\nprint df.lfn\n\nGrid files that are replicated at CERN are directly accessible via EOS. We can \nsee that our file's on EOS by looking at the LFN Ganga gave us. We just need to \nadd the prefix /eos/lhcb/grid/user to the LFN.\neos ls /eos/lhcb/grid/user//lhcb/user/a/apearce/GangaFiles_22.24_Wednesday_18_May_2016\n\n Using MassStorageFileThe MassStorageFile object uploads job output directly to EOS. However, \nusing MassStorageFile for this purpose is actively discouraged by the Ganga \ndevelopers as it is highly inefficient: a file made on the Grid will first be \ndownloaded to the machine running Ganga, and then uploaded to EOS.\nInstead, always use DiracFile for large outputs, and then replicate them to \nCERN-USER if you want to be able to access them on EOS.\n\nIf you have any DiracFile, you can ask for it to be replicated to a grid site \nit's not currently available at.\ndf.replicate('CERN-USER')\n\n Automating replication to CERNIf you have a job with subjobs, you can automate this to replicate all output \nfiles to CERN, so that you can run your analysis directly on the files on \nEOS.\nj = jobs(...)\nfor sj in j.subjobs:\n  # Get all output files which are DiracFile objects\n  for df in sj.outputfiles.get(DiracFile):\n    # No need to replicate if it's already at CERN\n    if 'CERN-USER' not in df.locations:\n      df.replicate('CERN-USER')\n\nYou could make a function from this and put it in your .ganga.py file, whose \ncontents is available in any Ganga session.\n\nYou can download a DiracFile locally using the get method. If you already \nknow an LFN, you can use this to quickly download it locally to play around \nwith it. All you need to do is prefix the LFN with LFN:, and Ganga will \nassume that the file already exists on the Grid somewhere (whereas before it \nassumed the file was local).\ndf2 = DiracFile('LFN:' + df.lfn)\n# The directory used for the download must exist first\n!mkdir foo\ndfr2.get(localPath='foo')\n!cat foo/input.txt\n\nWe can tell Ganga to upload the job output to the Grid automatically.\n# Clone the job\nj2 = Job(j)\nj2.outputfiles = [DiracFile('*-reversed.txt')]\nj2.submit()\n\nHere we use a ‘pattern’ to tell Ganga that any file ending in *-reversed.txt \nshould be uploaded to Grid storage. Both DiracFile and LocalFile support \nthese patterns.\nTo download the output, we use .get as usual.\nj2.outputfiles.get(DiracFile)[0].get(localPath='.')\n\nBeing able to manipulate files with Ganga can be very useful. Particularly for \nGaudi-based jobs where:\n\nWe often specify large sets of DiracFiles as input, from the bookkeeping, \nbut often want to download a file or two locally when testing options;\nWe want to duplicate a large number of output LFNs to CERN-USER so that we \ncan use them directly with EOS and XRootD commands;\nWe want to job output to be download locally automatically when the job \ncompletes.\n\n Defining inputfilesThe inputfiles attribute of a Job object works in a similar way to \noutputfile. In our example, the reverser script that the Executable \napplication uses doesn't know how to handle things specified as inputdata, \nso we had to use File when defining the arguments.\nFor LHCb applications, you will almost always define the inputdata list \nusing either LocalFile or DiracFile objects. Which one you will use just \ndepends on where the input files are.\n\n"}}}
