will be ready for the workshop!\n\n \nPlease read and try the following steps before arriving. For\nsome of the steps the solution requires waiting for a day or so.\nSo please try them before arriving and try to fix what ever does\nnot work.\n\nFollow this guide before arriving, we will not have time to help\nyou with problems on these issues during the workshop. This means\nyou will end up watching instead of participating.\n\nThis will be an interactive workshop, so you will need to bring\na computer. There will be no machines for you to use in the room.\n\nFollow all the steps using the computer you plan to bring, not\nyour desktop or someone else's computer.\n\nIf this is the first time you are bringing your laptop to CERN, you\nwill have to register it before it can\naccess the internet. Both the WiFi and the ethernet connection need to be \nregistered.\nPlease bring an ethernet/network cable (even if you have WiFi) and\nyour power supply, as well as a plug adaptor to Swiss and European plugs.\n WindowsIn the following we assume you use Mac OS X or Linux. If you are running\nWindows, step 2 is replaced by a list of instructions given at the bottom\nof this page.\n \nTry the following steps with the computer you will use at the workshop:\n\nIn your browser try and access the web-based book keeping.\nIf you need help with your grid certificate there is the\nGrid certificate FAQ\nand you can ask questions on lhcb-distributed-analysis@cern.ch.\nFrom a terminal (xterm on Linux or Terminal on Mac OS X) connect to \nlxplus with ssh -X lxplus.cern.ch.\nIf your local username is different from your lxplus one use ssh -X mylxplusname@lxplus.cern.ch.\nPlease try exactly this command even if you usually use an alias or other shortcut.\nOnce connected, check your grid certificate works by typing\nlhcb-proxy-init. If you need help with your grid certificate there is the\nGrid certificate FAQ\nand you can ask questions on project-lcg-vo-lhcb-admin@cern.ch.\nlhcb-proxy-init will ask you for the password of your grid certificate and then print something like:\nGenerating proxy...\nEnter Certificate password:\nAdded VOMS attribute /lhcb/Role=user\nUploading proxy for lhcb_user...\nUploading proxy for private_pilot...\nProxy generated:\nsubject      : /DC=ch/DC=cern/OU=Organic Units/OU=Users/CN=thead/CN=667505/CN=Timothy Daniel Head/CN=proxy/CN=proxy\nissuer       : /DC=ch/DC=cern/OU=Organic Units/OU=Users/CN=thead/CN=667505/CN=Timothy Daniel Head/CN=proxy\nidentity     : /DC=ch/DC=cern/OU=Organic Units/OU=Users/CN=thead/CN=667505/CN=Timothy Daniel Head\ntimeleft     : 23:53:59\nDIRAC group  : lhcb_user\npath         : /tmp/x509up_u25636\nusername     : thead\nproperties   : NormalUser\nVOMS         : True\nVOMS fqan    : ['/lhcb/Role=user']\n\nProxies uploaded:\nDN                                                                                 | Group         | Until (GMT)\n/DC=ch/DC=cern/OU=Organic Units/OU=Users/CN=thead/CN=667505/CN=Timothy Daniel Head | lhcb_user     | 2015/08/25 08:05\n/DC=ch/DC=cern/OU=Organic Units/OU=Users/CN=thead/CN=667505/CN=Timothy Daniel Head | private_pilot | 2015/08/25 08:05\n\nCheck that X11 forwarding works by typing xeyes on lxplus. A set\nof eyes following your mouse should appear on your screen. Press\nCtrl-C to exit.\n\n\nIf you can successfully execute all of the above steps, you are ready to go for \nthe workshop!\n Using BashThe Bash shell) will be used \nthroughout the workshop.\nThe default for new LHCb computing accounts is now Bash. If you have an older\naccount, the default used to be a shell called tcsh \n(“tee-cee-shell”), which has subtly different ways of doing things \nin comparison with Bash.\nIt is recommended to change your default shell to Bash if this is the case, which is much more \nwidely used than tcsh and also supported by LHCb, by visiting the your \nCERN account page, then clicking “Resources and \nservices”, then “List services”, “LXPLUS and Linux”, “Settings”, then change \n“Unix shell” to /bin/bash, and click “Save Selection”.\nIf you don't want to change your default shell, just execute the bash \ncommand when you login to lxplus.\n \n Windows-specific InstructionsOn Windows, some additional steps are required before you can connect via SSH.\nSet up steps (you only have to perform this once):\n\nDownload the Xming installer.\nRun the installer.\nDownload PuTTY.\n\nThe following steps have to be executed each time you want to connect:\n\nStart PuTTY.\nIn the list on the left, unfold Connection and SSH, then click the X11 item.\nIn the window that appears, make sure the check box labeled Enable X11 forwarding is checked.\nReturn to the previous window by selecting Session int he list on the left.\nIn the text box labeled Host Name (or IP address), type lxplus.cern.ch.\nMake sure the Port text box contains the number 22.\nClick the Open button on the bottom of the screen.\nA window appears with the text login as:. Type your CERN username, followed by Enter.\nThe window should say Using keyboard-interactive authentication. Password:. Type your password, again followed by Enter.\nYou now have a remote SSH session at an lxplus server node!\n\n \n"},"first-analysis-steps/install-party.html":{"url":"first-analysis-steps/install-party.html","title":"Install party","keywords":"","body":"Install party\n Learning Objectives\nInstall git from source\nInstall Anaconda\n\n \nIn order to follow the Basics part of the workshop (first two days) you will\nneed to have recent versions of Python and Git installed either on your laptop\nor on lxplus.\nThe instructions below explain how you can install Python and libraries for\nscientific computing on lxplus by using the the Anaconda Python distribution.\nAfter that, they explain how you can compile a recent version of git, because\nthe default version on lxplus is very old and doesn't support all the features\nwe'll need.\n Health warningOnce you install things yourself you have an environment that is different\nfrom the \"standard\" LHCb setup. It means you have to keep software up-to-date\nyourself and when things start going wrong everyone will blame it on your\ncustom setup. Keep that in mind. With great tools comes great responsibility.\n \nAnaconda is a complete set of python interpreter and useful libraries. For example\nit comes with ipython pre-installed as well as matplotlib and scikit-learn.\nTo install Anaconda on lxplus or your Mac/Linux laptop follow these\ninstructions:\n\nVisit the Anaconda downloads page.\nMake sure to select the correct operating system (Windows, Mac or Linux)\nFor lxplus download the Linux 64bit - Python2.7 installer. To do this, right click on 64-bit installer for python 2.7 and click on copy link address.To begin installing this on lxplus you need to use wget:\n$ wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh\n\nWhere the argument to wget is the link address you copied. The link address may change as new versions of anaconda are released so be aware!\n\nThen on lxplus type bash Anaconda2-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh in the\ndirectory to which you downloaded the installer. Use bash no matter\nwhat your shell actually is.\nFollow the on-screen instructions and go with the default answer to\nall questions.\n\nThis will install a modern set of python libraries to ~/anaconda. This means you\nneed to have some free space on your AFS home directory. Once it is done check\nthat the installer added these two lines to your .bashrc:\n# added by Anaconda2 4.2.0 installer\nexport PATH=\"~/anaconda2/bin:$PATH\"\n\nLog out of lxplus and back in. Now you should be able to start python as well as\nipython, etc.\n Removing AnacondaTo remove Anaconda temporarily, simply comment out the two lines that were\nadded to your .bashrc file. To permanently remove it simply delete the anaconda\ndirectory in your home directory.\n \nTo install git \"from source\" on lxplus follow these instructions.\n\nVisit the git repository on github\nClick on \"releases\", which takes you to the list of all git releases\nDownload the .tar.gz for the latest release (v2.10.2) to lxplus:$ wget https://github.com/git/git/archive/v2.10.2.tar.gz\n\n\nunpack the .tar.gz with tar xzf v2.10.2.tar.gz\nChange to the newly created git-2.10.2 directory: cd git-2.20.2\nFollow the INSTALL\ninstructions.\nTo install git in your home directory type:$ export CURLDIR=$HOME/anaconda\n$ mkdir $HOME/git-install-2.10.2\n$ make prefix=$HOME/git-install-2.10.2\n$ make prefix=$HOME/git-install-2.10.2 install\n\n\nAdd the following line to your .bashrc:export PATH=\"$HOME/git-install-2.10.2/bin:$PATH\"\n\n\n\n Removing gitTo temporarily remove git remove the line you added to your .bashrc, and delete\nthe git-install-2.10.2 directory in your home directory to remove it permanently.\n \n"},"first-analysis-steps/introduction-to-course.html":{"url":"first-analysis-steps/introduction-to-course.html","title":"Goals of the course","keywords":"","body":"Goals of the course\n Learning Objectives\nUnderstand what we'll be doing, and why we'll be doing it.\n\n \nThe first LHCb Starterkit is all about getting you the data you need to do your \nphysics analysis.\nWe'll start from the very beginning, explaining how proton-proton collisions \nmake their way to long-term storage, and will end with having a ROOT ntuple \ncontaining all the variables you might want to look at for making your \nmeasurement.\nWe want this course to give you the confidence to be able to start by yourself, \nto understand what the code you'll be writing does and why you're writing it, \nand to teach others how to do the same.\nEach lesson follows on from the previous one, but each can also serve as a \nstandalone reference when you need to revisit a particular topic.\nWe'll be looking at:\n\nHow data flows through the LHCb processing chain, what software is involved, \nand how the data are stored;\nHow the data flow is different for simulated (Monte Carlo) events;\nWhere the data ends up, how it's indexed, and how you can find and access the \ndata you need;\nHow to get candidate decays from the LHCb data format to ROOT ntuples;

The application responsible for the software trigger \nis Moore, which will be discussed in further detail in the trigger lesson.\nTriggered, raw data are reconstructed to transform the detector hits into \nobjects such as tracks and clusters. This is done by the Brunel \napplication. The objects are stored into an output file in a ‘DST’ format.\nThe reconstructed DST files are suitable for analysis, but they are not \naccessible to users due to computing restrictions. Data are filtered \nfurther through a set of selections called the stripping, controlled by \nthe DaVinci application which write out data either in the DST or ‘µDST’ \n(micro-DST) format. To save disk space and to speed up access for analysts, the \noutput files are grouped into streams which contain similar selections.\nBy grouping all of the fully hadronic charm selections together, for \nexample, analysts interested in that type of physics don't waste time running \nover the output of the dimuon selections.\n The output formatA DST file is a ROOT file which contains the full event information, such as \nreconstructed objects and raw data. Each event typically takes around 150kB of \ndisk space in the DST format.\nThe µDST format was designed to save space by storing only the \ninformation concerning the build candidates (that is, the objects used \nto construct particle decays like tracks); the raw event, which takes \naround 50kB per event, is discarded.\n \n\nUsers can run their own analysis tools to extract variables for their \nanalysis with the DaVinci application. The processing is slightly different \nbetween DST and µDST, since some calculations need the other tracks in the \nevent (not only the signal), which are not available in the latter format.\n\n\nWe also produced lots of simulated events, often called Monte Carlo data, and \nthis is processed in a very similar way to real data.\nThis similarity is very beneficial, as the simulated data is subject to the \nsame deficiencies as in the processing of real data.\nThere are two simulation steps which replace the proton-proton collisions and \nthe detector response:\n\nThe simulation of proton-proton collisions, and the hadronisation and decay \nof the resulting particles, are ultimately controlled by the Gauss \napplication. Gauss is responsible for calling the various Monte Carlo \ngenerators that are supported such as Pythia (the default in LHCb) and POWHEG, \nand for controlling EvtGen and Geant4. EvtGen is used to describe the decays of \nsimulated particles, whilst Geant4 is used to simulate the propagation and \ninteraction of particles through and with the detector.\nThe simulated hits made in the virtual detector are converted to signals \nthat mimic the real detector by the Boole application. The output of Boole \nis designed to closely match the output of the real detector, and so the \nsimulated data can then be passed through the usual data processing chain \ndescribed above, beginning with the trigger.\n\nSo, the data flow and the associated applications look like this:\n\nKnowing this flow is essential in selecting your data! Different application \nversions can produce very different physics, so it's very useful to know how \neach application has manipulated the data you want to use.\n Why are there multiple applications?It's often simpler to create and visualise a single, monolithic program that \ndoes everything, but that's not how the data flow is set up in LHCb. Why not? \nWhat are the advantages of splitting up the software per task? What are the \ndisadvantages?\n \nWith the exception of a few specific studies, it is only the DaVinci \napplication that is run by users, everything else is run ‘centrally’ either on \nthe computing farm next to the detector or on the Grid.\nThe reconstruction, Brunel, is rarely performed as it is very computationally \nintensive.\nIt is only done when the data are taken and when a new reconstruction \nconfiguration is available.\nThe stripping can be performed more often, since it runs on reconstructed data.  \nStripping ‘campaigns’, when the stripping selections are centrally run, are \nidentified by a version as SXrYpZ:\n\nThe digit X marks the major stripping version. This marks all major \nrestrippings, in which the full list of selections are processed.\nThe digit Y is the release version, which was used during Run 1 to mark \nthe data type, which corresponds to the year the data were taken: 0 was \nused for 2012 and 1 for 2011. The latest stripping for Run 1 data is called \nS21 for 2012 and S21r1 for 2011.\nThe digit Z marks the patch version, which correspond to incremental \nstrippings; campaigns in which only a handful of selections are run, either \nto fix bugs or to add a small number of new ones.\n\nKnowing the reconstruction and stripping versions is often the most important \npart in choosing your data, because the selections generally always change \nbetween major stripping versions, and variables can look very different between \nreconstruction versions.\nThe list of stripping selection largely defines the reconstructed decays that \nare available to you, but the list is very long as there's a lot we can do with \nour data. If you don't know the stripping line you need, it's usually best to \nask the stripping coordinators of the working group you'll be presenting your \nwork to. To learn more about the stripping, the best resource is the stripping \npage on the LHCb\nTWiki.\nIn it we can find:\n\nThe status of the current stripping, e.g. for Stripping \nS21r1.\nThe configuration of all past stripping campaign, e.g. for Stripping \nS20.\n\nAdditionally, the information on all strippings can be found in the stripping \nproject \nwebsite, \nwhere you can see all the algorithms run and cuts applied in each line.\nFor example, if we wanted to understand the \nStrippingD2hhCompleteEventPromptDst2D2RSLine line, which we used in the \nexploring a DST lesson from now on, we would go \nhere.\n"},"first-analysis-steps/run-2-data-flow.html":{"url":"first-analysis-steps/run-2-data-flow.html","title":"Changes to the data flow in Run 2","keywords":"","body":"Changes to the data flow in Run 2\n Learning Objectives\nUnderstand how the LHCb data flow differs between Run 1 and Run 2\n\n \nRun 1 of the LHC ran from 2010 to the end of 2012. Run 2 began in the middle of \n2015 and is scheduled to continue until 2019.\nDuring Run 1 the LHC provided proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass \nenergy of 7 and 8 TeV, and in Run 2 the energy increases to 13 TeV.\nWith an increase in energy comes an increase in production cross-sections, and \nso a much higher rate of interesting events.\nSo now we have many more events that we would like to store, but as ever \nwe're limited by computing resources.\nTo help overcome this, LHCb introduced the Turbo stream in 2015, whereby the \nselection of candidates made in the second stage of the high level trigger, \nHLT2, is saved to disk and used directly by analysts, with no further offline \nreconstruction by Brunel.\nOmitting the offline reconstruction is usually a Bad Idea because it's usually \nof a much better quality than the reconstruction performed in the HLT (the \n‘online reconstruction’) as there's more time to run it. But, thanks an \nenormous effort improving the reconstruction software both online and offline \nin between Run 1 and Run 2, the two reconstructions now perform identically.\nThis means if HLT2 performs all the reconstruction you need in your analysis, \nthere's no need to wait for the offline reconstruction to run!\nThis saves a lot of time (it's Turbo, after all), and hence money).\nThis saves time and money, but you still have many more events to save. To \novercome this, events saved to the Turbo stream contain only the candidates \nthat were reconstructed in the trigger. That is to say, any tracks or detector \nresponses that don't form part of the decay that the trigger lines uses to \nevaluate its selection is thrown away.\nThis is quite pragmatic, because a lot of analyses don't use this information \nanyway.\nThe Turbo stream runs in parallel with the regular data flow, and so everything \nnow looks like this:\n\nThe change here is the addition of the Turbo stream in the storage output of \nthe trigger.\nThis stream cannot be re-reconstructed because the information needed to do \nthat is thrown away to save disk space.\nFrom our point of view, though, this doesn't change things much because we can run \nDaVinci over the Turbo stream in exactly the same manner as for the stripping \noutput. We will just need to look in a different place to find the selection \ndefinitions, this time for trigger lines rather than stripping lines.\nIt's best to ask the trigger coordinator in your working group if your analysis \nhas a trigger line that outputs to the Turbo stream, and if so where to find \nthe selection definitions.\n"},"first-analysis-steps/davinci.html":{"url":"first-analysis-steps/davinci.html","title":"An introduction to LHCb Software","keywords":"","body":"An introduction to LHCb Software\n Learning Objectives\nLearn the key concepts needed to work with the LHCb software\nLearn how to launch the LHCb software with lb-run\n\n \nImagine you want to design and run a new particle detector.\nApart from organizing a collaboration, creating the design and specification, and several other tasks, you will also have to find solutions to many computational challenges.\nIt's worth thinking about these for a second:\n\nHow do we collect data as it is recorded by the detector?\nHow do we filter and process the recorded data efficiently?\nHow do we manage all the complex tasks required to work with collision data?\nHow do we organize all the data of a single bunch crossing in a flexible way?\nHow do we configure our software flexibly without having to recompile it?\nCan you think of more?\n\nHow would you go about solving these?\nThe decisions you make will affect the performance of your experiment during datataking and analysis.\nAt LHCb, we base our software on the Gaudi framework, which was specifically designed with the above questions in mind.\nIt's worth getting an idea of some of the most important Gaudi concepts at this point.\nAfter this, we will jump right into running the software and getting useful things done.\nEvent Loop\nBecause the individual bunch crossings (events) are almost completely independent of each other, it makes sense to process them one by one, without holding them all in memory at once.\nGaudi provides a global EventLoop, which allows you to process events one by one.\nTransient Event Store\nA single event contains lots of different data objects (Particles, Vertices, Tracks, Hits, ...).\nIn Gaudi, these are organized in the Transient Event Store (TES).\nYou can think of it as a per-event file system with locations like /Event/Rec/Track/Best or /Event/Phys/MyParticles.\nWhen running over the event stream, Gaudi allows you to get and put from/to these locations.\nThe contents of the TES are emptied at the end of the processing of each event.\nAlgorithms\nAn Algorithm is a C++ class that can be inserted into the EventLoop.\nThese allow you to perform a certain function for each event (like filtering according to trigger decision, reconstructing particles, ...).\nTools\nOften, algorithms will want to make use of some common function (vertex fitting, calculating distances, associating a primary vertex, ...).\nThese are implemented as Tools, which are shared between Algorithms.\nOptions\nTo make all of this configurable, Gaudi allows you to set properties of Algorithms and Tools from a Python script, called an option file.\nIn an option file, you can specify which Algorithms are run in which order, and set their properties (strings, integers, doubles, and lists and dicts of these things can be set).\nYou can then start the Gaudi EventLoop using this option file, and it will set up and run the corresponding C++ objects with specified settings.\nYou can find comprehensive documentation in the Gaudi Doxygen or the Gaudi Manual.\nUsually, you will work with one of the LHCb software projects that are based on Gaudi.\nOne of the most important ones is DaVinci, which provides lots of Algorithms and Tools for physics analysis.\nYou can run DaVinci using the following command:\nlb-run DaVinci/v41r2 gaudirun.py\n\nThis will run the gaudirun.py command using version v41r2 of DaVinci.\ngaudirun.py is a script that sets up the EventLoop.\nYou should get the following output:\n# setting LC_ALL to \"C\"\nApplicationMgr

Python script that specifies how to set things up in the software.\nMany of the following lessons will teach you how to do something with DaVinci by showing you how to write or extend an

(Not all simulated \nsamples have the same requirements made on the signal decay.)\nIf you expand the 27163003 (Dst_D0pi,Kpi=DecProdCut) folder you\nwill find several different subfolders to choose from. The names of these \nsubfolders correspond to different data-taking conditions, such as magnet \npolarity (MagDown and MagUp), as well as different software versions used \nto create the different samples that are available. We will use \nBeam4000GeV-2012-MagDown-Nu2.5-Pythia8.\n So much choice!Often there are only one or two combinations of data-taking conditions and \nsoftware versions to choose from, but sometimes there can be very many.\nGenerally newer versions are the best bet, but you should always ask the \nMonte Carlo liason of your working group for advice on what to use if you're \nnot sure.\n\nNext we need to choose what version of the simulation you want to\nuse. Usually the latest available version is best, which is Sim08e in\nthis case. We also have to choose the version of the\ndigitisation and what configuration of the trigger and reconstruction\nwe want to have in the simulated sample. Usually\nthere is only one choice for these, which makes choosing easier.\nWe also have to select a version of the stripping. Choose any as long as it \ncontains the word Flagged.\n Flagged and filtered samplesIn the usual data-taking flow, the trigger and stripping are run in \nfiltering mode, whereby events that don't pass any trigger line or any \nstripping line are thrown away. In the simulation, it's often useful to keep \nsuch events so that the properties of the rejected events can be studied.\nThe trigger and stripping are then run in flagging mode, such that the \ndecisions are only recorded for later inspection.\nFiltered Monte Carlo can be produced for analyses that need lots of events.\n\nAfter all this, you will be presented with a ALLSTREAMS.DST entry.

However not every event will contain a candidate for your line,\nso the first tool we need is something that will advance us until\nthe stripping decision was positive:\ndef advance(decision):\n    \"\"\"Advance until stripping decision is true, returns\n    number of events by which we advanced\"\"\"\n    n = 0\n    while True:\n        appMgr.run(1)\n\n        if not evt['/Event/Rec/Header']:\n            print 'Reached end of input files'\n            break\n\n        n += 1\n        dec=evt['/Event/Strip/Phys/DecReports']\n        if dec.hasDecisionName('Stripping{0}Decision'.format(decision)):\n            break\n\n    return n\n\nAdd this to your script and restart ipython as before.\n Detecting file endsIt is not easy to detect that the input file has ended. Especially\nif you want to get it right for data and simulation. Checking that\n/Event/Rec/Header exists is a safe bet in simulation and data if\nyour file has been processed by Brunel (the event reconstruction\nsoftware). It might not work in other cases.\n \nUsing the name of our stripping line we can now advance through the\nDST until we reach an event which contains a candidate:\nline = 'D2hhCompleteEventPromptDst2D2RSLine'\nadvance(line)\n\nThe candidates built for you can now be found at /Event/AllStreams/Phys/D2hhCompleteEventPromptDst2D2RSLine/Particles:\ncands = evt['/Event/AllStreams/Phys/D2hhCompleteEventPromptDst2D2RSLine/Particles']\nprint cands.size()\n\nThis tells you how many candidates there are in this event and you can access the first\none with:\nprint cands[0]\n\nWhich will print out some information about the Particle. In our case a D*. You can access its daughters with\ncands[0].daughtersVector()[0] and cands[0].daughtersVector()[1],\nwhich will be a D0 and a pion.\nThere is a useful tool for printing out decay trees, which you can\npass the top level particle to and it will print out the daughters etc:\nprint_decay = appMgr.toolsvc().create(\n  'PrintDecayTreeTool', interface='IPrintDecayTreeTool'\n)\nprint_decay.printTree(cands[0])\n\nWith our candidates in hand, it would be nice to be able to retrieve and\ncompute the variables we need for an analysis. On to LoKi\nfunctors!\n Fast DST browsingWhile here we have discussed for pedagogical reasons all the configuration\noptions needed in order to browse a DST file, in your daily life as a\nphysicist it is often useful to use the bender application that belongs to\nthe Bender project.\nFor example, to explore the DST we could have simply done:\nlb-run Bender/latest bender 00035742_00000002_1.allstreams.dst\nThis leaves us in a prompt in which we can proceed as discussed in this\nlesson, with the advantage that some functions are already provided\nfor us, such as seekStripDecision (which replaces our advance) or\nls and get, which allow to list and get TES locations.\nOther examples of useful functions are listed in the bender starting\nbanner.\nBender also provides a useful command dst-dump, which is a quick way of\nfiguring out what objects are present on a DST and where. Try out:\nlb-run Bender/latest dst-dump -f -n 100 00035742_00000002_1.allstreams.dst\nThe -f option tells Bender to try and \"unpack\" the locations such as\n/Event/AllStreams/pPhys/Particles that we mentioned above, while -n 100\ntells it to only process the first 100 events on the DST.\nGive this a try if you're ever stuck figuring out where your candidates are hiding!\n \n"},"first-analysis-steps/loki-functors.html":{"url":"first-analysis-steps/loki-functors.html","title":"Fun with LoKi Functors","keywords":"","body":"Fun with LoKi Functors\n Learning Objectives\nUnderstand what LoKi functors are\nUse LoKi functors interactively\nBe able to find functors that do what we want\n\n \nLoKi functors are designed to flexibly compute and compare properties of the \ncurrent decay, from simple quantities such as the transverse momentum of a \nparticle to complicated ones like helicity angles.\nInternally, functors are implemented as C++ classes that take an object of type TYPE1 and return another of TYPE2.\nThey can be used both in C++ and in Python code, and can be combined with each other using logical operations.\nAccording to TYPE2 there are 3 types of functors:\n\nFunctions, which return double.\nPredicates, which return a bool.\nStreamers, which return a std::vector of some other type TYPE3.\n\nWhen filling tuples, the most used functors are functions, while predicates are typically used for selections.\nAccording to TYPE1, there are many types of functors, the most important of which are (you can find a full list in the LoKi FAQ):\n\nParticle functors, which take LHCb::Particle* as input.\nVertex functors, which take LHCb::VertexBase* as input.\nMC particle functors, which take LHCb::MCParticle* as input.\nMC vertex functors, which take LHCb::MCVertex* as input.\nArray particle functors, which take a LoKi::Range_ (an array of particles) as input.\nTrack functors, which take LHCb::Track as input.\n\n C++ classesThings like LHCb::Particle are C++ classes that usually represent some \nphysical object. You will interact with the C++ objects directly very rarely, \nif ever.\n \nTo understand what we can do with LoKi functors, we will pick up from where we \nleft off exploring a DST interactively.\nOpen the DST and get the first candidate in the D2hhCompleteEventPromptDst2D2RS line:\ncands = evt['/Event/AllStreams/Phys/D2hhCompleteEventPromptDst2D2RSLine/Particles']\ncand = cands[0]\n\nWe can now try to get very simple properties of the $$D^{*+}$$ candidate, such \nas its transverse momentum and measured mass.\nfrom LoKiPhys.decorators import PT, M\nprint PT(cand)\nprint M(cand)\n\nYou will see an error when loading the functors:\nLoKiSvc.REPORT      ERROR LoKi::AuxDesktopBase:     loadDesktop(): unable to load IPhysDesktop! StatusCode=FAILURE\nLoKiSvc.REPORT      ERROR The   ERROR message is suppressed : 'LoKi::AuxDesktopBase:     loadDesktop(): unable to load IPhysDesktop!' StatusCode=FAILURE\nThis is related to the fact that some functors need to run in the DaVinci \n‘scope’, and they are all loaded in the LoKiPhys.decorators module. It's \nharmless in the examples we will use.\nIf the import is made before the instantiation of the ApplicationMgr, there \nwill be no warnings.\nMath operations are also allowed:\nfrom LoKiPhys.decorators import PX, PY, PZ\np_components_sum = PX + PY + PZ\np_components_sum(cand)\n\n Does it make sense?Retrieve the momentum magnitude $$p$$ and see if you can get the same answer \nwith the `PX`, `PY`, `PZ` functors.\nAlso compute the invariant mass $$m$$ and see if it matches what the M \nfunctor returned.\n \nIf we want to get the properties of the $$D^{*+}$$ vertex, for example its fit \nquality ($\\chi^2$), we need to pass an object to the functor.\nfrom LoKiPhys.decorators import VCHI2\nprint VCHI2(cand.endVertex())\n\nThis is inconvenient when running DaVinci with Python options \nfiles, since in that case we don't have any way of \ncalling the endVertex method.\nInstead, we can use the VFASPF adaptor functor, which allows us to use \nvertex functors as if they were particle functors (note how the functor is \nbuilt by combining two functors).\nfrom LoKiPhys.decorators import VFASPF\nVCHI2(cand.endVertex()) == VFASPF(VCHI2)(cand)\n\n Functions of functions of functions of…Make sure you understand what VFASPF(VCHI2)(cand) means. It may help to play \naround in Python, creating a function that takes another function as an \nargument, for example:\ndef create_greeting(salutation):\n    def greet(name):\n        print '{0}, {1}!'.format(salutation, name)\n    return greet\n\nWhat would create_greeting('Hello') return? What about \ncreate_greeting('Howdy')('partner')? Why is doing this useful?\n \nThe calculation of some of the properties, such as the impact parameter (IP) or \ndirection angle (DIRA), require the knowledge of the primary vertex (PV) \nassociated to the candidate.\nIn GaudiPython, we can get the PVs ourselves.\npv_finder_tool = appMgr.toolsvc().create(\n    'GenericParticle2PVRelator/P2PVWithIPChi2',\n    interface='IRelatedPVFinder'\n)\npvs = evt['/Event/AllStreams/Rec/Vertex/Primary']\nbest_pv = pv_finder_tool.relatedPV(cand, pvs)\nfrom LoKiPhys.decorators import DIRA\nprint DIRA(best_pv)(cand)\n\nGiven that this is a very common operation, we have the possibility of using, in the context of a DaVinci application (Stripping, for example), a special set of functors, starting with the BPV prefix (for Best PV), which will get the PV for us.\nSome functors also end with the suffix DV, which means they can only be used in the DaVinci context.\n Finding LoKi functorsThe full list of defined LoKi functors can be found in the LoKi::Cuts \nnamespace in the \ndoxygen.\nThey are quite well documented with examples on how to use them.\nThe list can be overwhelming, so it's also worth checking a more curated selection of functors in the TWiki, here and here.\n \nSo far we've only looked at the properties of the head of the decay (that is, \nthe $$D^{*+}$$), but what if we want to get information about its daughters? As \nan example, let's get the largest transverse momentum of the final state \nparticles.\nA simple solution would be to navigate the tree and calculate the maximum \n$$p_{\\text{T}}$$.\ndef find_tracks(particle):\n    tracks = []\n    if particle.isBasicParticle():\n        proto = particle.proto()\n        if proto:\n            track = proto.track()\n            if track:\n                try:\n                    tracks.append(particle.data())\n                except AttributeError:\n                    tracks.append(particle)\n    else:\n        for child in particle.daughters():\n            tracks.extend(find_tracks(child))\n    return tracks\n\nmax_pt = max([PT(child) for child in find_tracks(cand)])\n\n A note about the try/exceptIf you import LoKi before running this example, it magically removes the \n.data() function and allows the particle to be used directly. The code above \nis made general using the try/except block and will work in either case.\n \nHowever, LoKi offers functions for performing such operations, namely MAXTREE and MINTREE, which get as parameters the selection criteria, the functor to calculate and a default value.\nIn our example,\nfrom LoKiPhys.decorators import MAXTREE, ISBASIC, HASTRACK\nMAXTREE(ISBASIC & HASTRACK, PT, -1)(cand) == max_pt\n\nIn this example, we have used two selection functors, ISBASIC and HASTRACK, which return true if the particle doesn't have children and is made up by a track, respectively.\nWe can see that they do the same thing as particle.isBasicParticle() and particle.proto().track() in a more compact way.\n Combining LoKi cutsYou might have noticed above we used the & operator (\"bitwise AND\") to \ncombine the ISBASIC and HASTRACK cuts above.\nThis is because Python doesn't allow LoKi to override the behaviour of and and or (\"logical AND/OR\"), so if we use them\nthe Python interpreter tries to combine the two cuts straight away, before we have even passed in our candidate:\nIn [1]: ((M>1200) or (PT > 500))\nOut[1]:  (M>1200)\n\nthe result is that our PT cut vanishes!\nIf we use the | operator (\"bitwise OR\") then LoKi correctly builds a functor representing the OR of our cuts:\nIn [2]: ((M>1200) | (PT > 500))\nOut[2]:  ( (M>1200) || (PT>500) )\n\nThis is why you should always use & and | when combining LoKi functors, and never use and and or.\n \nSimilarly, the SUMTREE functor allows us to accumulate quantities for those children that pass a certain selection:\nfrom LoKiPhys.decorators import SUMTREE, ABSID\nprint SUMTREE(211 == ABSID, PT)(cand)\nprint SUMTREE('pi+' == ABSID, PT)(cand)\n\nIn this case, we have summed the transverse momentum of the charged pions in the tree.\nNote the usage of the ABSID functor, which selects particles from the decay \ntree using either their PDG Monte Carlo \nID or their name.\nAnother very useful LoKi functor is CHILD, which allows us to access a \nproperty of a single children of the particle.\nTo specify which child we want, its order is used, so we need to know how the candidate was built.\nFor example, from\nIn [10]: cand.daughtersVector()\nOut[10]:\n\n 0 |->D0                           M/PT/E/PX/PY/PZ: 1.8624/ 6.4521/ 47.44/-4.939/-4.152/ 46.96 [GeV]  #  0\n                                       EndVertex  X/Y/Z:0.2911/-0.2378/-14.38 [mm]  Chi2/nDoF 0.4039/1 #  0\n 1    |->K-                        M/PT/E/PX/PY/PZ: 0.4937/ 2.8013/ 25.45/-1.799/-2.147/ 25.29 [GeV]  # 19\n 1    |->pi+

D0 is the first child and pi+ is the second.\nTherefore, to access the $$p_{\\text{T}}$$ of the $$D^{0}$$ we have 2 options.\nfrom LoKiPhys.decorators import CHILD\n# Option 1\nmass = M(cand.daughtersVector()[0])\n# Option 2\nmass_child = CHILD(M, 1)(cand)\n# Do they agree?\nmass == mass_child\n\nThe usage of LoKi functors extends much further than in the interactive \nGaudiPython world we've been exploring here.\nThey constitute the basis of particle filtering in the selection framework, \ndiscussed in the Building your own decay \nchain \nlesson in \nsecond-analysis-steps.\nSelecting particles means using LoKi predicates, functors that give a bool \noutput, like ISBASIC and HASTRACK.\nAmongst these, a key functor is in_range, which returns True if the value \nof the given function functor (that is, the functor that returns a double) \nis within the given lower and upper limit.\nIt helps writing CPU-efficient functors and thus is very important when building time-critical software like trigger or stripping lines.\nfrom LoKiCore.functions import in_range\nin_range(2000, M, 2014)(cand)\nin_range(1860, CHILD(M, 1), 1870)(cand)\n\nAdditionally, LoKi functors can be used directly inside our DaVinci jobs to store specific bits of information in our ntuples without the need for a complicated C++-based algorithms.\nThis second option will be discussed in the TupleTools and branches lesson.\n Debugging LoKi functorsIf you write complicated LoKi functors, typically in the context of selections, \nyou need functions for debugging when things go wrong.\nLoKi provides wrapper functors that evaluate a functor (or functor expression), print debugging information and return the result;\nthe most important of these are:\n\ndump1, which prints the input object and returns the calculated functor value,from LoKiCore.functions import dump1\ndebug_p_components_sum = dump1(p_components_sum)\ndebug_p_components_sum(cand)\n\n\nmonitor which prints the input the functor string and returns the calculated functor value,from LoKiCore.functions import monitor\nmonitor_p_components_sum = monitor(p_components_sum)\nmonitor_p_components_sum(cand)\n\n\n\n

locally\nLooping event-by-event over a file and inspecting\ninteresting quantities with LoKi functors is great for\nexploration: to checking that the file contains the candidates you need, that\nthe topology makes sense, and so on.\nIt's impractical for most cases, though, where you want all the candidates\nyour trigger/stripping line produced, which could be tens of millions of\ndecays.\nIn these cases we use DaVinci, the application for analysing high-level\ninformation such as tracks and vertices, which we'll look at in this lesson to\nproduce a ROOT ntuple.\n Learning Objectives\nRun a DaVinci job over a local DST\nInspect the ntuple output\nSet up the job to run in Ganga\n\n \nWith some stripped data located, it's useful to store the information on the\nselected particles inside an ntuple.\nThis allows for quick, local analysis with ROOT,\nrather than always searching through a DST that contains lots of things we're\nnot interested in.\nAs well as being the application that runs the stripping,\nDaVinci\nallows you to access events stored in DSTs and copy the information to ROOT\nntuples.\nYou tell DaVinci what you want it to do through options files, written in\nPython.\nThere are lots of things you can do with DaVinci options files, as there's lots\nof information available on the DST, but for now we'll just work on getting the\nbare essentials up and running.\nOur main tool will be the DecayTreeTuple object, which we'll create inside a\nfile we will call ntuple_options.py:\nfrom Configurables import DecayTreeTuple\nfrom DecayTreeTuple.Configuration import *\n\n# Stream and stripping line we want to use\nstream = 'AllStreams'\nline = 'D2hhCompleteEventPromptDst2D2RSLine'\n\n# Create an ntuple to capture D*+ decays from the StrippingLine line\ndtt = DecayTreeTuple('TupleDstToD0pi_D0ToKpi')\ndtt.Inputs = ['/Event/{0}/Phys/{1}/Particles'.format(stream, line)]\ndtt.Decay = '[D*(2010)+ -> (D0 -> K- pi+) pi+]CC'\n\nThis imports the DecayTreeTuple class, and then creates an object called\ndtt representing our ntuple.\nOnce DaVinci has run, the resulting ntuple will be saved in a folder within the\noutput ROOT file called TupleDstToD0pi_D0ToKpi.\nThe Inputs attribute specifies where DecayTreeTuple should look for\nparticles, and here we want it to look at the output of the stripping line\nwe're interested in.\nAs stripping lines can save many decays to a DST, the Decay attribute\nspecifies what decay we would like to have in our ntuple.\nIf there are no particles at the Input location, or the Decay string\ndoesn't match any particles at that location, the ntuple will not be filled.\n Decay descriptorsThere is a special syntax for the Decay attribute string, commonly called\n'decay descriptors', that allow a lot of flexibility with what you accept.\nFor example, D0 -> K- X+ will match any D0 decay that contains one\nnegatively charged kaon and one positively charged track of any species.\nMore information the decay descriptor syntax can be found on the LoKi decay\nfinders TWiki\npage.\n \nNow we need to tell DaVinci how to behave.\nThe DaVinci class allows you to tell DaVinci how many events to run over,\nwhat type of data is being used, what algorithms to run over the events, and so\non.\nThere are many configuration\nattributes\ndefined on the DaVinci object, but we will only set the ones that are\nnecessary for us.\nfrom Configurables import DaVinci\n\n# Configure DaVinci\nDaVinci().UserAlgorithms += [dtt]\nDaVinci().InputType = 'DST'\nDaVinci().TupleFile = 'DVntuple.root'\nDaVinci().PrintFreq = 1000\nDaVinci().DataType = '2012'\nDaVinci().Simulation = True\n# Only ask for luminosity information when not using simulated

DaVinci object are self-explanatory:\nInputType should be 'DST' when giving DaVinci DST files; PrintFreq\ndefines how often DaVinci should print its status; DataType is the year of\ndata-taking the data corresponds to, which we get from looking at the\nbookkeeping path used to get the input DST; Simulation should be True when\nusing Monte Carlo data, Lumi defines whether to store information on the\nintegrated luminosity the input data corresponds to; and EvtMax defines how\nmany events to run over, where a value of -1 means \"all events\".\nThe CondDBtag and DDDBtag attributes specify the exact detector conditions\nthat the Monte Carlo was generated with.\nSpecifying these tags is important, as without them you can end up with the\nwrong magnet polarity value in your ntuple, amongst other Bad Things.\nYou can find the values for these tags in the bookkeeping\nfile\nwe downloaded earlier.\n Database tagsGenerally, the CondDB and DDDB tags are different for each dataset you\nwant to use, but will be the same for all DSTs within a given dataset.\nWhen using simulated data, always find out what the database tags are for\nyour dataset!\nFor real collision data, you shouldn't specify these tags, as the default\ntags are the latest and greatest, so just remove those lines from the options\nfile.\n \nIn order to run an algorithm that we have previously created, we need to add it\nto the UserAlgorithms list.\nThe TupleFile attribute defines the name of the ROOT output file that DaVinci\nwill store any algorithm output in, which should be our ntuple.\nAll that's left to do is to say what data we would like to run over.\nAs we already have a data file downloaded locally, we\ndefine that as our input data.\nfrom GaudiConf import IOHelper\n\n# Use the local input data\nIOHelper().inputFiles([\n    './00035742_00000002_1.allstreams.dst'\n], clear=True)\n\nThis says to use the .dst file that is in the same directory as the options\nfile, and to clear any previous input files that might have been defined.\nThat's it!

This will list all of your jobs, their status, what kind of\napplication they are and more.\nYou can get more detailed information about your job by typing\njobs($jobid), replacing $jobid with the id of the job you are\ninterested in. For concretness we will assume you are interested in\na job with jobid 787 in this example.\nOnce your job has finished its status will be completed. Check this\nby typing jobs or by printing out the status of one particular job:\nprint 'Status of my job:', jobs(787).status\n\nThe next thing to do is to find the output of your job. Two things can\nhappen to files your job creates:\n\nThey get downloaded by ganga, or\nthey are stored \"on the grid\".\n\nBy default ganga will download most files below a size of XX MB.

For example, if we wanted further information from the tracks, such as the number of degrees of freedom of the track fit, we would have to turn on the verbose mode of the tool:\ntrack_tool.Verbose = True\n\nIf we don't need to configure the tool or we want to use the defaults, there's no need for storing the returned tool in a variable.\nFor example, if we wanted the information of the PV associated to our particle, we could just add the TupleToolPrimaries with no further configuration:\ndtt.addTupleTool('TupleToolPrimaries')\n\nThe way the DecayTreeTuple.Decay is written in in our minimal DaVinci job,\ndtt.Decay = '[D*(2010)+ -> (D0 -> K- pi+) pi+]CC'\n\nmeans that the configured TupleTools will only run on the head of the decay chain, that is, the D*(2010)+.\nIn order to select the particles for which we want the information stored, we need to mark them with a ^ symbol in the decay descriptor.\nFor example, if we want to fill the information of the D0 and its children, as well as the soft pi+, we would modify the above line to look like this:\ndtt.Decay = '[D*(2010)+ -> ^(D0 -> ^K- ^pi+) ^pi+]CC'\n\nThis will run all the configured TupleTools on the marked particles, with the caveat that some tools are only run on certain types of particles (eg, tracking tools on particles that have an associated track).\nThis configuration is not optimal, since there may be tools which we only want to run on the D's and some only on the children. Enter Branches, which allow us to specify which tools get applied to which particle in the decay (in addition to the TupleTools configured at the top level).\nBranches let you define custom namespaces in your ntuple by means of a dict.\nIts keys define the name of each branch (and, as a consequence, the prefix of the corresponding leaves in the ntuple), while the corresponding values are decay descriptors that specify which particles you want to include in the branch.\ndtt.addBranches({'Dstar' : '[D*(2010)+ -> (D0 -> K- pi+) pi+]CC',\n                 'D0'    : '[D*(2010)+ -> ^(D0 -> K- pi+) pi+]CC',\n                 'Kminus': '[D*(2010)+ -> (D0 -> ^K- pi+) pi+]CC',\n                 'piplus': '[D*(2010)+ -> (D0 -> K- ^pi+) pi+]CC',\n                 'pisoft': '[D*(2010)+ -> (D0 -> K- pi+) ^pi+]CC'})\n\nNote that in order to use branches, we have to make sure that all particles we want to use are marked in the main decay descriptor (dtt.Decay).\nDaVinci will ignore branches for particles that have not been marked in dtt.Decay!\nOnce the branches have been configured, they can be accessed as dtt.PARTICLENAMEand TupleTools can be added as discussed before.\nFor example, if we want to store the proper time information of the D0, we would do\ndtt.D0.addTupleTool('TupleToolPropertime')\n\n Do I really have to type my decay descriptor that many times?No! You can use the (new) dtt.setDescriptorTemplate() method to set up your \ndecay descriptor and branches in just one line!\nWell, nearly: because this is a new feature it is not available in most released versions of DaVinci, but this snippet will add it to an older version.\nWith that out of the way, you can simply use\ndtt.setDescriptorTemplate('${Dstar}[D*(2010)+ -> ${D0}(D0 -> ${Kminus}K- ${piplus}pi+) ${pisoft}pi+]CC')\n\nThis will set up both dtt.Decay and Branches for you.\n \nThe usage of Branches is very important (and strongly encouraged) to keep the size of your ntuples small, since it prevents us from storing unneeded information (for example trigger information, which will be discussed at a later lesson).\n Where to find TupleToolsOne of the most difficult things is to know which tool we need to add to our \nDecayTreeTuple in order to get the information we want.\nFor this, it is necessary to know where to find TupleTools and their code.\nTupleTools are spread in 9 packages under Analysis/Phys (see the master branch in git here), all starting with the prefix DecayTreeTuple, according to the type of information they fill in our ntuple:\n\nDecayTreeTuple for the more general tools.\nDecayTreeTupleANNPID for the NeuralNet-based PID tools.\nDecayTreeTupleDalitz for Dalitz analysis.\nDecayTreeTupleJets for obtaining information on jets.\nDecayTreeTupleMC gives us access to MC-level information.\nDecayTreeTupleMuonCalib for muon calibration tools.\nDecayTreeTupleReco for reconstruction-level information, such as TupleToolTrackInfo.\nDecayTreeTupleTracking for more detailed tools regarding tracking.\nDecayTreeTupleTrigger for accessing to the trigger information of the candidates.\n\nThe TupleTools are placed in the src folder within each package and it's usually easy to get what they do just by looking at their name.\nHowever, the best way to know what a tool does is check its documentation, either by opening its .h file or be searching for it in the latest doxygen.\nMost tools are very well documented and will also inform you of their configuration options.\nAs an example, to get the information on the TupleToolTrackInfo we used before we could either check its source code or its web documentation.\n In case we need more information or need to know exactly what the code does, the fill method is the one we need to look at.\n As a shortcut, the list of tupletools can also be found in doxygen at the top of the pages for the IParticleTupleTool and the IEventTupleTool interfaces (depending on whether they fill information about specific particles or the event in general).\n \nThe updated options can be found here.\n Test your ntupleRun the options in the same way as in the minimal DaVinci \njob lesson.\nYou will obtain a DVntuple.root file, which we can open and inspect with ROOT's TBrowser:\n$ root DVntuple.root\nroot [0]\nAttaching file DVntuple.root as _file0...\nroot [1] TBrowser *b = new TBrowser()\nroot [2]\nTry to locate the branches we have added, which are placed in the TupleDstToD0pi_D0ToKpi/DecayTree, and plot some distributions by double-clicking the leaves.\n \nPicking up with the LoKi functors lesson, let's store some specific bits of information discussed there in our ntuple.\nTo add LoKi-based leaves to the tree, we need to use the LoKi::Hybrid::TupleTool, which is configured with 3 arguments:\n\nIts name, specified in the addTupleTool call after a /.  This is \nvery useful (and recommended) if we want to have different \nLoKi::Hybrid::TupleTool for each of our branches. For instance, we may \nwant to add different information for the D*, the D0 and the soft $$\\pi$$:dstar_hybrid = dtt.Dstar.addTupleTool('LoKi::Hybrid::TupleTool/LoKi_Dstar')\nd0_hybrid = dtt.D0.addTupleTool('LoKi::Hybrid::TupleTool/LoKi_D0')\npisoft_hybrid = dtt.pisoft.addTupleTool('LoKi::Hybrid::TupleTool/LoKi_PiSoft')\n\n\nThe Preambulo property, which lets us perform preprocessing of the LoKi \nfunctors to simplify the code that is used to fill the leaves, for example \ncreating combinations of LoKi functors or performing mathematical \noperations:preamble = [\n   'DZ = VFASPF(VZ) - BPV(VZ)',\n   'TRACK_MAX_PT = MAXTREE(ISBASIC & HASTRACK, PT, -1)'\n]\ndstar_hybrid.Preambulo = preamble\nd0_hybrid.Preambulo = preamble\n\n\nThe Variables property, consisting of a dict of (variable name, LoKi \nfunctor) pairs. In here, LoKi functors can be used, as well as any \nvariable we may have defined in the Preambulo:dstar_hybrid.Variables = {\n   'mass': 'M',\n   'mass_D0': 'CHILD(M, 1)',\n   'pt': 'PT',\n   'dz': 'DZ',\n   'dira': 'BPVDIRA',\n   'max_pt': 'MAXTREE(ISBASIC & HASTRACK, PT, -1)',\n   'max_pt_preambulo': 'TRACK_MAX_PT',\n   'sum_pt_pions': 'SUMTREE(211 == ABSID, PT)',\n   'n_highpt_tracks': 'NINTREE(ISBASIC & HASTRACK & (PT > 1500*MeV))'\n}\nd0_hybrid.Variables = {\n   'mass': 'M',\n   'pt': 'PT',\n   'dira': 'BPVDIRA',\n   'vtx_chi2': 'VFASPF(VCHI2)',\n   'dz': 'DZ'\n}\npisoft_hybrid.Variables = {\n   'p': 'P',\n   'pt': 'PT'\n}\n\n\n\nIn the code snippets specified above (available here), you can see that the NINTREE functor counts the number of particles that pass the specified criteria. While this is not very useful for ntuple-building (we can always do it offline), it's a very powerful functor to use when building decay selections.\n Getting more practiceIn the LoKi::Hybrid::TupleToolwe've used some  functors that have not been \ndescribed previously. Find out what they do in the \ndoxygen.\nTo check SUMTREE and CHILD, run the code above and check that the Dstar_max_pt and Dstar_max_pt_preambulo and the Dstar_mass_D0 and D0_mass branches have exactly the same values.\n \n"},"first-analysis-steps/decay-tree-fitter.html":{"url":"first-analysis-steps/decay-tree-fitter.html","title":"How do I use DecayTreeFitter?","keywords":"","body":"How do I use DecayTreeFitter?\n Learning Objectives\nAdd a kinematic fitter to a branch in the decay tree\nApply a mass constraint\nInspect the refitted decay tree\n\n \nOnce you have made a hypothesis on the chain of decays that lead to your final state, you then can incorporate the additional knowledge that comes with this hypothesis to get a new best estimate for the particle parameters -- in particular their momenta. The additional knowledge is represented as constraints, which your decay tree has to fulfill.\nFor example, for the decay\n'[D*(2010)+ -> (D0 -> K- pi+) pi+]CC'\n\nyou can make the assumption that the (K- pi+) combine to form a D0 with a specific invariant mass. This results in a so called mass-constraint. In addition the kaon and the pion should originate from exactly the same point in space. If you know that your data only contains prompt D candidates, you can constrain them to do come from the primary vertex. Boundary conditions like those are called vertex-constraints*.\nApplying such kinematic constraints leads to new best estimates for the track parameters of the final state particles. The process of calculating those is called a kinematic refit and the TupleToolDecayTreeFitter is the algorithm that performs this task for us.\n The physics and mathematics behind DecayTreeFitterFor details of the method see the paper on Decay chain fitting with a Kalman \nfilter.\n \nSo how do we use a TupleToolDecayTreeFitter to our DaVinci script? Let's create a branch to add the tool to. We'll just name it 'Dstar':\ndtt.addBranches({\n    'Dstar': '[D*(2010)+ -> (D0 -> K- pi+) pi+]CC',\n})\n\nTo this branch we can now apply the TupleToolDecayTreeFitter.\ndtt.Dstar.addTupleTool('TupleToolDecayTreeFitter/ConsD')\n\nNow we can proceed with the configuration of the fitter. We are going to constrain the decay tree to the primary vertex of origin. We want all the output available, so we set the verbose option. Finally we want to apply the mass constraint on the D0:\ndtt.Dstar.ConsD.constrainToOriginVertex = True\ndtt.Dstar.ConsD.Verbose = True\ndtt.Dstar.ConsD.daughtersToConstrain = ['D0']\n\nNote that you can constrain more than one intermediate state at once if that fits your decay.\nWhen using the DecayTreeFitter in a DecayTreeTuple, all the variables created by the other TupleTools are not affected by the change, but some new variables are created, one set per DecayTreeFitter instance. Depending on whether the Verbose option is specified, the new variables are created for the head particle only or for the head particle and its daughters too.\nIf the daughters are not stable particles and decay further, the daughters of the daughters have no new variables associated to them by default.\nSince in many cases this information might be useful, there is an option to store the information from those tracks\ndtt.Dstar.ConsD.UpdateDaughters = True\n\n DecayTreeFitter and LoKi functorsAlternatively, many of the operations described above can done by using the \nDecayTreeFitter via LoKi functors, see the DaVinci \ntutorial for \ndetails.\n \n Which constraints to applyIt is important to be aware what assumptions you bake into your ntuple. For \nexample, after you require the vertex constraint you must be careful if using \nthe IPCHI2_OWNPV, since the particle you are looking at is forced to point \nto the PV. Which constraints make most sense for you depends on the questions \nyou want to ask in your analysis, so ask your supervisor/working group in case \nof doubt.\n \nOnce you have produced your ntuple you can have a look at the refitted variables.\nroot -l DVntuple.root\nTupleDstToD0pi_D0ToKpi->cd()\nDecayTree->StartViewer()\n\nPlotting the raw mass of the D* (without the fit) Dstar_M you should see a broad signal around 2 GeV:\n\n Which mass variable to useIn many ntuples you also find a mass variable called _MM. This confusingly \nrefers to measured mass. However, it is usually better to use _M. _MM is \nthe sum of the 4-momenta of the final state particles extrapolated back to the \nfitted vertex position, but not the result of the actual vertex fit.\n \nNow let us look at the refitted mass of the D*, with the D0 constrained to its nominal mass. It is stored in the variable Dstar_ConsD_M. If you plot this you will note that some values are unphysical. So, let's restrict the range we look at to something that makes sense.\nOn the root prompt use the arrow-up key to get the last draw command and modify it to pipe the output into a histogram:  \ntv__tree->Draw(\"Dstar_ConsD_M>>h(200,2000,2030)\",\"\",\"\");\n\n\nNote that this plot has 356 entries, although we only have 128 candidates in the raw mass spectrum. The reason for this is, that we typically have several primary vertices per event. When you use the vertex contraint, the fitter is run for each of the possible vertex hypothesis available in the event. So all the Dstar_ConsD-xxx variables are in fact arrays, where the first value corresponds to the best PV hypothesis. We can plot only those by doing\ntv__tree->Draw(\"Dstar_ConsD_M[0]>>h(200,2000,2030)\",\"\",\"\");\n\nand we get the final kinematically refitted Dstar mass:\n\nFinally, let's check how the D0 mass constraint has played out.\ntv__tree->Draw(\"Dstar_ConsD_D0_M[0]>>h(100,1800,1900)\",\"\",\"\", 128, 0);\n\n\nAs expected, the D0 candidates are forced onto their PDG mass value.\n Explore\nLook at the status variable to check if the fits converged.\nLook at the chi2 distribution of the fit\n\n \nDecayTreeFitter can be told to change some of the hypotheses in the decay tree. This is very useful if you want to slightly change which decays you want to look at. As an example let's say we want to examine the Cabibbo-suppressed decay of the D0 into pi- pi+ instead of K- pi+. For this we add a second fitter, giving it a new name ConsDpipi:\ndtt.Dstar.addTupleTool('TupleToolDecayTreeFitter/ConsDpipi')\ndtt.Dstar.ConsDpipi.constrainToOriginVertex = True\ndtt.Dstar.ConsDpipi.Verbose = True\ndtt.Dstar.ConsDpipi.daughtersToConstrain = ['D0']\n\nWe now can tell the fitter to substitute the kaon in the D0 decay by a pion.\ndtt.Dstar.ConsDpipi.Substitutions = {\n    'Charm -> (D0 -> ^K- pi+) Meson': 'pi-',\n    'Charm -> (D~0 -> ^K+ pi-) Meson': 'pi+'\n}\n\nIn the dictionary that is passed to the Substitutions property of the fitter, the keys are decay descriptors, where the respective particle to be substituted is marked with a ^. The values are the respective new particle hypotheses. The substitution will only work if you start from a decay descriptor that actually matches your candidates. However, you are allowed to generalise parts of the decay. Here we replaced D*(2010) with the more general Charm and the bachelor pi- is just represented by a Meson.\nNote that the substitution mechanism does not understand the CC symbol. Both charge states have to be specified explicitely.\nRunning the ntuple script again with these additions gives you fit results for the re-interpreted decay.\n Challenge\nCompare the outcome of the two fits with the different mass hypothesis\nCompare the fit quality between the correct and the the wrong hypothesis\n\n \nThe solution to this exercise ntuple_DTF1.py, is available\nhere.\n"},"first-analysis-steps/ganga-data.html":{"url":"first-analysis-steps/ganga-data.html","title":"More Ganga","keywords":"","body":"More Ganga\n Learning Objectives\nSet the input data with BKQuery\nUse LHCbDatasets\nSet the location of the output of our jobs\nSet the location of your .gangadir\nAccess output stored on the grid\n\n \nThe input data can be specified for your job with the BKQuery tool.

In this case only files named DVntuple.root will match.\nThe outputfilenameformat tells ganga where inside your EOS area to\nstore the file and how to name it. The full path to this particular\nfile will be:\n/eos/lhcb/user/a/another/starterkit/{jid}_{fname}\n\n Special outputfileformat patternsYour outputfilenameformat string can contain several special\nstrings which will be replaced on a file by file basis. The special\nstrings are: {jid}, {sjid} and {fname}. They stand for job ID,\nsubjob ID, and the filename of the matched file respectively.\n \n Subjobs and outputfileformatWhen using subjobs it is important to make sure you include the\n{sjid} pattern in your outputfilenameformat string, otherwise\nall the subjobs will overwrite each others output.\n \nThe final line tells your ganga job that the outputfiles of this\njob that need special treatment.\nOne important thing to note is that ganga has to be running after\nyour job has completed to copy the files to EOS. The job can not\ncopy things to EOS itself. You can leave ganga running in a\nscreen session and it will copy files as they\nbecome available.\nOnce your job has completed and the files have been copied to\nEOS by ganga you can access them from your terminal by mounting\nyour EOS area.\n Important!Important: mounting eos is discouraged by the LHCb data management team,\nand no support will be provided by them for problems/questions related to it.\n \nOn lxplus EOS is mount under /eos like this:\n$ ls -al /eos/user\n\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x. 1 daemon root 269935142640435 Oct  6  2014 .\ndrwxr-xr-x. 9 root   root               0 Oct 24 11:30

Objectives\nLearn how to process many files in parallel on the grid\nby splitting a job into many subjobs\n\n \nIn the previous lesson, you've submitted a job to the LHC grid.\nYou will notice that the job will take a long time to finish.\nThis is because it has to process many gigabytes of data.\nganga provides several splitters that implement strategies for processing data in parallel.\nThe one we will use now is SplitByFiles, which spawns several subjobs, each of which only processes a certain number of files.\nApart from processing data faster, this will also allow you to work with datasets that are spread across several sites of the LHC grid.\nThis is because a job can only access datasets that are available on the site that it runs on.\nTo activate a splitter, assign it to the .splitter attribute of your job:\nj.splitter = SplitByFiles(filesPerJob=5)\n\nNote that the specified number of files per job is only the allowed maximum.\nYou will often get jobs with fewer files.\n How do I choose the number of files per job?Choose fewer files per job if possible, as this will allow you to finish sooner \nand reduces the impact of jobs failing due to grid problems.\nSetting filesPerJob=5 should work well for real data, while filesPerJob=1 should be good for signal MC.\n \nNow, when you run j.submit(), the job will automatically be split into several subjobs.\nThese can be displayed by entering\njobs(787).subjobs\n\nin ganga, where you have to replace 787 with the id of your main job.\nYou can access individual subjobs as in jobs(787).subjobs(2).\nFor example, to resubmit a failed subjob, you would run\njobs(787).subjobs(2).resubmit()\n\nTo access several subjobs at once, you can use the .select method:\njobs(787).subjobs.select(status='failed').resubmit()\n\nThis will resubmit all failed subjobs.\nIf you want to do something more complex with each subjob, a regular for-loop can be used as well:\nfor j in jobs(787).subjobs:\n    print(j.id)\n\nIt's possible that some of your subjobs will be stuck in a certain state (submitting/completing/...).\nIf that is the case, try to reset the Dirac backend:\njobs(787).subjobs(42).backend.reset()\n\nIf that doesn't help, try failing the job and resubmitting:\njobs(787).subjobs(42).force_status('failed')\njobs(787).subjobs(42).resubmit()\n\nIt can take quite a while to submit all of your subjobs.\nIf you want to continue working in ganga while submitting jobs, you can use the queues feature to do just that.\nSimply call queues.add with the submit function of a job without adding parentheses, like this:\nqueues.add(j.submit)\nGanga will then submit this job (and its subjobs) in the background.\nMake sure not to close ganga before the submission is finished, or you will have to start submitting the rest of the jobs again later on.\n Splitting your first jobTry splitting the ganga job from our previous lesson with splitByFiles=1 \n(reference code) and submit it with ganga.\n

to work with and modify LHCb software projects and packages\nLearn how to find and search the source code and its documentation\n\n \n PrerequisitesBefore starting, you should have a basic understanding of how to use git,\nsimilar to what has been\ntaught during the\nStarterkit.\n \nIn this lesson, we'll show you a complete workflow for developing the LHCb\nsoftware using the git version control system.  At LHCb, we use Gitlab to\nmanage our git repositories.  Among other features, Gitlab allows you to browse\nthe source code for each project, and to review new changes (called merge\nrequests) in a convenient web interface.  You can find the CERN Gitlab\ninstance at https://gitlab.cern.ch.\nIn principle, there are multiple ways of interacting with the LHCb software\nrepositories:\n\nA vanilla git workflow using only the standard git commands.  This requires\nyou to clone and compile an entire LHCb project at a time.\nAn LHCb-specific workflow using a set of lb-* subcommands.  This allows\nyou to check out individual packages inside a project, and streamlines the\nmodification of a few packages at a time.  (This is closer to the previously\nused getpack command.)\n\nHere, we want to focus on the second workflow. The first workflow will be\ndiscussed briefly at the bottom of\nthis page. Note that, although the lb-git commands are much easier for small\nchanges to existing packages where recompiling an entire project would be\ncumbersome, for any serious development the usage of vanilla git is much more\nstable. Please consider using it if you can spare the compilation time.\n Initial setupBefore jumping in by creating a project in Gitlab, you should make sure that\nyour local git configuration and your settings on Gitlab are sufficiently set\nup.\n\nYour name and email address should be set up in your local git\nconfiguration.  To ensure that this is the case, run\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\ngit config --global user.email \"Your Name \"\nand put in your information.\n\nNext, connect to https://gitlab.cern.ch and log in with your CERN \ncredentials. Visit https://gitlab.cern.ch/profile/keys and add an SSH key.\n\nFinally, run this LHCb-specific configuration command:\ngit config --global lb-use.protocol ssh\nThis makes sure the LHCb commands use the ssh protocol instead of https.\n\n\n \nThis lesson introduces you the commands:\n\nlb-dev for setting up a new development environment\ngit lb-use and git lb-checkout for downloading LHCb software packages\n\nIf you want to make changes to a software package, you will need to set up a\ndevelopment environment. lb-dev is your friend here:\nlb-dev --name DaVinciDev DaVinci/v42r2\n\nThe output should look similar to this:\nSuccessfully created the local project DaVinciDev in .\n\nTo start working:\n\n  > cd ./DaVinciDev\n  > git lb-use DaVinci\n  > git lb-checkout DaVinci/vXrY MyPackage\n\nthen\n\n  > make\n  > make test\n\nand optionally (CMake only)\n\n  > make install\n\nYou can customize the configuration by editing the files 'build.conf' and\n'CMakeLists.txt' (see http://cern.ch/gaudi/CMake for details).\n lb-dev created local projects are Git repositoriesWhen lb-dev creates the local project directory and create the initial\nfiles there, it also calls git init and commits to the local Git repository\nthe first version of the files (try with git log in there).\nYou can then use git to keep track of your development, and share your code\nwith others (for example with a new project in\ngitlab.cern.ch).\n \nFollow those instructions to compile the software:\ncd DaVinciDev\ngit lb-use DaVinci\nmake\n\nOnce that's done, you can do\n./run bash -l\n\ninside the directory. This will (similar to lb-run) give you a new bash\nsession with the right environment variables set, from which you can run\nproject-specific commands such as gaudirun.py.\nYour new development environment won't be very useful without any software to\nmodify and build.  So let's check out one of the existing LHCb packages! These\nare stored in the LHCb Git repositories.\nIn order to obtain the source code of the package you want to work on, we'll\nuse the Git4LHCb scripts.\nThese are a set of aliases, starting with git lb-, that are designed to make\ndeveloping LHCb software easier.  For example, if you want to write a custom\nstripping selection, execute the following in the DaVinciDev directory:\ngit lb-use Stripping\ngit lb-checkout Stripping/master Phys/StrippingSelections\nmake configure\n\nUnder the hood, git lb-use will add the\nStripping repository as a remote in\ngit – check this with git remote -v!  git lb-checkout will then perform a\npartial checkout of the master branch of the Stripping repository, only\nadding the files under\nPhys/StrippingSelections.\n Which project to use in `git lb-use`?The project name to pass to git lb-use depends on the directories you want\nto check out and work on, and not on the project name you passed to lb-dev.\nMoreover you can call git lb-use several times for different remote\nprojects in the same local project:\nlb-dev --name DaVinciDev DaVinci/v42r2\ncd DaVinciDev\ngit lb-use Analysis\ngit lb-use Stripping\ngit lb-use DaVinci\n\nNot that in order for this to work, projects you specify in lb-use may not\ndepend on the project you specify in lb-dev. In other words, the top-level\nproject should be at the top of the dependency\nchain.\n \nYou can now modify the StrippingSelections package and run make purge &&\nmake to build it with your changes.  You can test your changes with the\n./run script.  It works similar to lb-run, without the need to specify a\npackage and version:\n./run gaudirun.py options.py\n\n What if `git` asks for my password?Make sure you succesfully completed the instructions under initial\nsetup.\n \nIf you have made changes that you'd like to be integrated into the official\nLHCb repositories, you can use git lb-push to push it to a new branch in the\ncentral git repository. But please read the instructions in the TWiki\npage\nfirst.\nDepending on the project, you may be required to document your changes in the\nrelease notes which are found in doc/release.notes.\nNote that no-one has permission to push directly to the master branch of any\nproject. In order to get your changes merged there from the branch to which you\nlb-pushed, you need to create a merge request, so the project maintainer can\ninspect your code. This can be done on the project repository web \npage, for\nexample.\n Quick link to create a merge requestWhen pushing to a branch in a project in Gitlab you will see a message like:\nremote:\nremote: Create merge request for my-branch:\nremote:   https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb/Stripping/merge_requests/new?merge_request%5Bsource_branch%5D=my-branch\nremote:\nYou can use the URL in the message to quickly create a merge request for the\nchanges you just pushed.\n \nWhen your merge request is approved (which can be after some additional commits\non your part), your changes are part of the master branch of the respective\nproject, and your contributions are officially part of the LHCb software stack.\nCongratulations!\n NightliesIt is advisable to test new developments on the so-called nightly\nbuilds. Each project is built overnight\n(hence the name), and all pending merge requests are applied. You can use a\nnightly build version of a project with:\nlb-dev --nightly lhcb-head DaVinci/HEAD\n\nA more detailed description of the command is found here:\n\nSoftwareEnvTools\n\nSometimes mistakes happen and the committed code is either not compiling or\ndoes not do what it is supposed to do.  Therefore the nightly tests are\nperformed. They first try to build the full software stack.\nIf that is successful, they run some reference jobs and compare the output of\nthe new build with a reference file.  The results of the nightly builds can\nbe found here.\n\nNightly builds summaries\n\nIf the aim of the commit was to change the ouput, e.g. because you increased\nthe track reconstruction efficiency by a factor of two, mention it in the\nmerge request description, such that the manager of the affected project can\nupdate the reference file.\n \nIf you want to take a look the source code, without checking it out, you can\neasily access the repository through the Gitlab web\ninterface. This website also provides search\nfunctionality, but the output is not always easy to read, especially if it\nreturns many hits. To search a project much quicker, you can use Lbglimpse.\nIt allows you to search for a given string in the source code of a particular\nLHCb project.\nLbglimpse \"PVRefitter\" DaVinci v42r2\n\nThis works with every LHCb project and released version. Since it's a shell\ncommand, you can easily process the output using less, grep, and other\ntools.\nTo get an idea of how a certain component of the LHCb software works, you can\nalso access the doxygen documentation. One set of doxygen web pages is\ngenerated for several related projects, and is linked in all the projects web\nsites, like for DaVinci.\nSee also the LHCb Computing web page for a\nlist of projects.\n Working with a full project checkoutThe lb-git commands are not strictly necessary, but they're very convenient\nif you just want to quickly edit one package. Otherwise you'd have to build\nthe entire project in which the package is residing, instead of using the\nprecompiled version. However, if you develop across multiple packages, or\nwant to use more sophisticated git commands, nothing prevents you from\nchecking out an entire project – just don't be surprised if it takes O(hours)\nto compile!\nTo check out a project, run the following:\ngit clone https://:@gitlab.cern.ch:8443/lhcb/DaVinci.git\n\nreplacing DaVinci with the project name of your choice. Next, initialise\nand compile it:\nlb-project-init make\n\noptionally followed by make test to run the tests and/or make install to\ninstall it to the InstallArea directory. That's all! You now have a vanilla\ngit repository containing all the source files of the project.\n \n"},"first-analysis-steps/asking-questions.html":{"url":"first-analysis-steps/asking-questions.html","title":"Asking good questions","keywords":"","body":"Asking good questions\n Learning Objectives\nHow to ask a good question\nWhere to ask questions\n\n \nEventually you will get stuck when trying to do something.\nThis lesson is about how to get help with getting unstuck.\nPeople love helping others. Below some tips on how to improve\nyour chances of getting a good answer. The answers you get\nwill depend very much on the way you ask your question.\n Mailing listsFor LHCb specific questions your best bet are the LHCb mailing\nlists like: \nlhcb-distributed-analysis@cern.ch,\nlhcb-davinci@cern.ch,\nand lhcb-soft-talk@cern.ch. For\nmore general questions Stack Overflow and\nGoogle are good starting places.\n \n LHCb Q&AAn experimental alternative to the mailing lists is the LHCb Questions and \nAnswers website.\nIt works like Stack overflow, but focuses on LHCb-specific questions.\nYou can post your question there and you should usually receive an answer within a few hours or days.\n \nThe title/subject is the first thing people will see of your\nquestion. If it is not interesting, they will not read the rest.\nIf you are struggling with a good title, write it last! Having\nwritten the rest of your email will give you a better idea of what\nthe one sentence summary is.\n Grammar and spellingThis is a no brainer. You want to make a good impression:\nsomeone who made an effort and values other people's time.\nIf you aren't comfortable with writing in English, ask a friend\nto proof-read your email for you.\n \nMost people like hard problems and thought-provoking questions. So\ngive them an interesting question to chew on, and they will love it.\nDespite this, mailing lists have a reputation for a hostile tone and\nan air of arrogance. People are hostile towards people who seem unwilling\nto think for themselves or did not do their homework before asking their\nquestion.\n VolunteersRemember people are volunteering their time to help you. They have busy\nlives and there are a lot of questions. So they filter ruthlessly. Make\nsure your question is the most interesting one out there, and people\nwill choose to help you.\n \nIt is OK that you are not technically competent, what you need to show is\nthat you have the skills to become competent: alert, thoughtful, observant,\nwilling to be an active partner in developing a solution.\nBefore posting your question try:\n\nSearching the archives of the forum/mailing list\nSearching the web\nFinding the answer in a FAQ\nFinding the answer by experimenting\nAsking a skilled friend\nOr reading the code\n\nWhen asking your question, mention which of these steps you have tried. It\nwill help demonstrate that you are not lazy and put in some effort. If you\nlearned something from trying this, mention it!\nThe beginning of your email should explain what you are trying to do and\nwhy, as well as where the problem occurs. Often it is useful to describe\nthe big goal, and not the particular step you are stuck with.\nHelp others reproduce your problem by including the necessary details. If\nthe problem is with code you wrote, include it. However do not post all of your\nprogram. Try and make a minimal example that demonstrates the problem. Stack\nOverflow has a good guide on creating a minimal, complete, and verifiable\nexample.\nYou have to be precise. Do not simply dump all possible information that\nmight be relevant. Vague questions receive vague answers. Being precise is\nuseful for at least three reasons. One: being seen to invest effort in simplifying\nthe question makes it more likely you'll get an answer, Two: simplifying\nthe question makes it more likely you'll get a useful answer. Three: In\nthe process of refining your bug report, you may develop a fix or workaround yourself.\nWhen people post replies or questions about your problem, follow them up. If\nyou manage to solve your problem, tell the mailing list.\n Love letters also known as private repliesPlease do not reply to questions privately. We are trying to solve a technical\nissue, not writing lover letters. If you take the discussion\noff the mailing list future generations will just see the question and no\nsolution. You will also miss out on help from others that did not chime\nin to your first question but might be able to help later on.\n \nOnce the problem is solved post a final message saying that the problem is\nsolved and what the solution is.\nA lot of the material in this topic was taken from the following, excellent\nguides to asking good questions:\n\nHow To Ask Questions The Smart Way by\nEric Raymond\nWriting the perfect question\nby Jon Skeet\nHow do I ask a good question? on Stack Overflow\n\n"},"first-analysis-steps/ecgd.html":{"url":"first-analysis-steps/ecgd.html","title":"Early career, gender and diversity","keywords":"","body":"Early career, gender and diversity\n Learning Objectives\nKnow about the existence of the ECGD office, where ECGD means Early Career, \nGender and Diversity.\nMeet the ECGD representatives\nLearn how/when the ECGD office can be useful for you.\n\n \nThe aim of the ECGD is to help LHCb achieve a working environment in which all LHCb members can thrive.
