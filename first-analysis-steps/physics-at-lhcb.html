</div></div> </p>
<p>The software that these lessons will cover was designed to make the types of
physics analyses most commonly performed at LHCb as easy as possible. When
using that software, it is then important to understand how those analyses are
done in order to understand why the software works the way it does.</p>
<p>At the highest level, a physics analysis tries to measure one or more
properties of objects produced through some process. At LHCb, this is typically
some production or decay properties of heavy flavour hadrons. Because these
objects have short lifetimes they decay before interacting with the detector,
and so we must infer their properties through their decay products. Particles
such as charged kaons and pions have lifetimes large enough that a large
fraction can traverse the full detector, and so we typically consider these
particles as &#x2018;stable&#x2019;. Unstable objects, with much shorter lifetimes, are
formed as combinations of these &#x2018;stable&#x2019; particles<sup><a href="#fn_2" id="reffn_2">2</a></sup>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Charged pions $$\pi^{\pm}$$</li>
<li>Charged kaons $$K^{\pm}$$</li>
<li>Protons $$p/\bar{p}$$</li>
<li>Electrons $$e^{\pm}$$</li>
<li>Muons $$\mu^{\pm}$$</li>
<li>Photons $$\gamma$$</li>
<li>Deuterons (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium" target="_blank">deuterium nuclei</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Many properties of these objects, such as their momentum and charge, are
intrinsic, but we have to infer them based on the signals they create
in the detector as they traverse through it.</p>
<h2 id="the-reconstruction">The reconstruction</h2>
<p>The properties of particles produced in collisions are known to Nature, but we
must reconstruct those properties based on the readout of the detector.
The process of inferring all properties is called <em>reconstruction</em>. For a given
proton-proton collision the reconstruction of all the objects is performed
simultaneously, e.g. one does not try to reconstruct one kaon, but reconstructs
all charged tracks at the same time, considering all available information.</p>
<p>An important output of the reconstruction is a set of <em>tracks</em>, each
representing the trajectory of a particle through the detector. Given that all
stable charged particles listed above have charge &#xB1;1, we can assign a momentum
estimate to a track based on its curvature, as induced by the LHCb dipole
magnet. We know the polarity of the magnet, as well as its field strength, so
can also infer the associated particle&#x2019;s charge.</p>
<p>A <em>vertex</em> represents some source of particle production in space. When
proton-proton bunches collided, several <em>primary vertices</em> can be created in
the interaction region. We can reconstruct primary vertices by looking for
intersections in space of large numbers of tracks.</p>
<p>Much more detail on the LHCb reconstruction can be found TODO. It is
recommended that you become familiar with at least the aspects of the
reconstruction that are relevant to your analysis. For now, we only need to
understand tracks and vertices, and how decays can be reconstructed and
selected from these.</p>
<h2 id="building-decay-candidates">Building decay candidates</h2>
<p>All objects created by the reconstruction contain contributions from detector
effects, such as resolution. In addition, not all created objects may
correspond to real particles; we could for example create &#x2018;ghost&#x2019; tracks,
trajectories created from combinations of random hits that together <em>look like</em>
a real trajectory.</p>
<p>Given this, we can never know anything with complete certainty. Instead we
must infer properties <em>statistically</em> based on ensembles of objects and events.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s say we want to count the number of <a href="http://pdglive.lbl.gov/Particle.action?init=0&amp;node=M070&amp;home=MXXX025" target="_blank">$$J/\psi$$ mesons</a> that
decay to two muons, $$\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$$. This proceeds via three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select tracks created by the reconstruction;</li>
<li>Create pairs of oppositely-charged tracks;</li>
<li>Fit each pair under the hypothesis that they originate from a common point
in space.</li>
</ol>
<p>We&#x2019;ll go over each of these steps, starting with tracks produced by the
reconstruction. Naturally, there are many of these in any given event,
typically hundreds, so we begin be applying <em>selections</em> on the tracks based on
our physics understanding. For example, the $$J/\psi$$ is quite heavy (at
around $$3.1\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}$$), so we might expect its decay products to have a
higher momentum on average than objects produced from soft processes in the
collision. The reconstruction gives us some probability-like
information for a given track to have been created by a true muon, so we might
require that the tracks we use have some minimum &#x2018;muon probability&#x2019;.</p>
<p>With a reduced set of a tracks, we can create all pairs of opposite-sign muons.
We know that a real particle decay happens at a point in space, so we could
require that the distance of closest approach between the two muons does not
exceed some maximum value. We could further require that the invariant mass of
the dimuon combination is close to the known mass of the $$J/\psi$$, invoking
the conservation of momentum.</p>
<p>With selected dimuon pairs, we can <em>fit</em> a $$J/\psi \to \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$$ decay
vertex. This is done by expressing the hypothesis that there is a common origin
vertex of both tracks as an optimisation problem, and then varying the measured
$$\mu^{+}$$ and $$\mu^{-}$$ four-momenta within their measured uncertainties to
best fit that hypothesis. The result is a vertex object which has, for example,
a fit $$\chi^{2}$$ associated to it. The quality of the fit can be used in a
selection.</p>
<p>Finally, with the fitted muon four-vectors, we can form the four-vector of the
$$J/\psi$$ as their sum, creating the $$J/\psi$$ <em>candidate</em><sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup>. Now we get
back to our original goal of measuring the number of true $$J/\psi \to
\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$$. By plotting the $$J/\psi$$ invariant mass values as a
histogram, we might hope to see a signal component. An example is shown in the
following plot, created using simulated toy data.</p>
<p><a href="img/dimuon_mass.png"><img alt="Dimuon invariant mass spectrum" src="img/dimuon_mass.png" style="width: 50%; margin: 0 25%;"></a></p>
<p>We could choose to model the components using probability density functions,
and fit the total model to this histogram. The relative normalisations of the
components can be used to deduce the fraction of the sample which contains true
decays, within some uncertainty.</p>
<h2 id="building-more-complex-decays">Building more complex decays</h2>
<p>With a set of $$J/\psi$$ candidates, we could build more complex decay chains
such as $$B_{s}^{0} \to J/\psi\phi(1020)$$.
The $$J/\psi$$ and the <a href="http://pdglive.lbl.gov/Particle.action?init=0&amp;node=M004&amp;home=MXXX005" target="_blank">$$\phi$$ meson</a> can decay in various ways,
but we might choose to reconstruct them in the $$\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$$ and
$$K^{+}K^{-}$$ final states, respectively.
The $$\phi \to K^{+}K^{-}$$ candidates can then be reconstructed in a similar
manner to that described previously for the $$J/\psi$$ decay.
With a set of $$J/\psi$$ and $$\phi$$ candidates, we can then build
<a href="http://pdglive.lbl.gov/Particle.action?init=0&amp;node=S086&amp;home=MXXX046" target="_blank">$$B_{s}^{0}$$ meson</a> candidates by combining the two decay products in
another vertex fit. If our selection is clean enough, we may then see a
$$B_s^{0}$$ signal peak, shown below (again, using toy data).</p>
<p><a href="img/jpsiphi_mass.png"><img alt="Four-body invariant mass spectrum" src="img/jpsiphi_mass.png" style="width: 50%; margin: 0 25%;"></a></p>
<p>As we&#x2019;ll see in the following lesson, lots of selections like these are run
centrally and produce output datasets that contain a mixture of decay chain
candidates. This course will show you how to extract the candidates and their
properties that are relevant for your analysis.</p>
