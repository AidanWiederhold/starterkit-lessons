<li>Understand the LHCb data flow</li>
<li>Learn the key concepts on the stripping</li>
</ul>
</div></div> </p>
<p>The Large Hadron Collider provides proton-proton collisions to LHCb 40 million 
times a second.
This results in a <em>huge</em> amount of data. In fact, if we were to store all the data coming in to LHCb, we would be recording ~ 1 TB <em>every second</em>.</p>
<p>That&apos;s too much data for us to be able to keep all of it, the price of storage 
is just too high, so instead we need to <em>filter</em> the data and try to keep only 
the events which contain something interesting.
This raises its own problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we filter and process the recorded data quickly and accurately?</li>
<li>How do we manage all the complex tasks required to work with collision data?</li>
<li>How do we organize all the data of a single bunch crossing in a flexible way?</li>
<li>How do we configure our software flexibly without having to recompile it?</li>
<li>Can you think of more?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions arise mostly due to two key points: the data must be processed 
very quickly because it&apos;s arriving very quickly, and the data is complex so 
there&apos;s a lot that can be done with it.</p>
<p>Collisions recorded by the LHCb detector go through a specific data flow 
designed to maximise the data-taking efficiency and data quality.
This consists of several steps, each one being controlled by an &#x2018;application&#x2019; 
that processes the data event-by-event, using the data from the previous step 
and creating the results ready for the next.
These steps are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data from the detector are filtered through the <em>trigger</em>, which consists 
of the L0, implemented in hardware, and the high level trigger (HLT), 
implemented in software. The application responsible for the software trigger 
is Moore, discussed in the <a href="../second-analysis-steps/hlt-intro.html">trigger lesson</a> 
in second-analysis-steps.</li>
<li>Triggered, raw data are reconstructed to transform the detector hits into 
objects such as tracks and clusters. This is done by the Brunel 
application. The objects are stored into an output file in a &#x2018;DST&#x2019; format.</li>
<li><p>The reconstructed DST files are suitable for analysis, but they are not 
accessible to users due to computing restrictions. Data are filtered 
further through a set of selections called the <em>stripping</em>, controlled by 
the DaVinci application which write out data either in the DST or &#x2018;&#xB5;DST&#x2019; 
(micro-DST) format. To save disk space and to speed up access for analysts, the 
output files are grouped into <em>streams</em> which contain similar selections.
By grouping all of the fully hadronic charm selections together, for 
example, analysts interested in that type of physics don&apos;t waste time running 
over the output of the dimuon selections.</p>
<p><div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title" onclick="javascript:toggle(5898670431);" id="the-output-format"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> The output format<span id="heading-5898670431"></span></h3></div><div class="panel-body" id="panel-5898670431"><p>A DST file is a ROOT file which contains the full event information, such as 
reconstructed objects and raw data. Each event typically takes around 150kB of 
disk space in the DST format.
The &#xB5;DST format was designed to save space by storing only the 
information concerning the build <em>candidates</em> (that is, the objects used 
to construct particle decays like tracks); the raw event, which takes 
around 50kB per event, is discarded.</p>
</div></div> </p>
</li>
<li><p>Users can run their own analysis tools to extract variables for their 
analysis with the DaVinci application. The processing is slightly different 
between DST and &#xB5;DST, since some calculations need the other tracks in the 
event (not only the signal), which are not available in the latter format.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We also produced lots of simulated events, often called Monte Carlo data, and 
this is processed in a very similar way to real data.
This similarity is very beneficial, as the simulated data is subject to the 
same deficiencies as in the processing of real data.
There are two simulation steps which replace the proton-proton collisions and 
the detector response:</p>
<ol>
<li>The simulation of proton-proton collisions, and the hadronisation and decay 
of the resulting particles, are ultimately controlled by the Gauss 
application. Gauss is responsible for calling the various Monte Carlo 
generators that are supported such as Pythia (the default in LHCb) and POWHEG, 
and for controlling EvtGen and Geant4. EvtGen is used to describe the decays of 
simulated particles, whilst Geant4 is used to simulate the propagation and 
interaction of particles through and with the detector.</li>
<li>The simulated hits made in the virtual detector are converted to signals 
that mimic the real detector by the Boole application. The output of Boole 
is designed to closely match the output of the real detector, and so the 
simulated data can then be passed through the usual data processing chain 
described above, beginning with the trigger.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, the data flow and the associated applications look like this:</p>
<p><a href="img/lhcb_data_flow.png"><img src="img/lhcb_data_flow.png" alt="&quot;The flow of real and simulated data during Run 1 of the LHC&quot;"></a></p>
<p>Knowing this flow is essential in selecting your data! Different application 
versions can produce very different physics, so it&apos;s very useful to know how 
each application has manipulated the data you want to use.</p>
<p><div class="panel panel-success"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title" onclick="javascript:toggle(1436562540);" id="why-are-there-multiple-applications"><i class="fa fa-square-o"></i> Why are there multiple applications?<span id="heading-1436562540"></span></h3></div><div class="panel-body" id="panel-1436562540"><p>It&apos;s often simpler to create and visualise a single, monolithic program that 
does <em>everything</em>, but that&apos;s not how the data flow is set up in LHCb. Why not? 
What are the advantages of splitting up the software per task? What are the 
disadvantages?</p>
</div></div> </p>
<p>With the exception of a few specific studies, it is only the DaVinci 
application that is run by users, everything else is run &#x2018;centrally&#x2019; either on 
the computing farm next to the detector or on the Grid.</p>
<p>The reconstruction, Brunel, is rarely performed as it is very computationally 
intensive.
It is only done when the data are taken and when a new reconstruction 
configuration is available.
The stripping can be performed more often, since it runs on reconstructed data.  </p>
<p>Stripping &#x2018;campaigns&#x2019;, when the stripping selections are centrally run, are 
identified by a version as <code>SXrYpZ</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The digit <code>X</code> marks the <em>major</em> stripping version. This marks all major 
<em>restrippings</em>, in which the full list of selections are processed.</li>
<li>The digit <code>Y</code> is the release version, which was used during Run 1 to mark 
the <em>data type</em>, which corresponds to the year the data were taken: <code>0</code> was 
used for 2012 and <code>1</code> for 2011. The latest stripping for Run 1 data is called 
<code>S21</code> for 2012 and <code>S21r1</code> for 2011.</li>
<li>The digit <code>Z</code> marks the <em>patch</em> version, which correspond to <em>incremental 
strippings</em>; campaigns in which only a handful of selections are run, either 
to fix bugs or to add a small number of new ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing the reconstruction and stripping versions is often the most important 
part in choosing your data, because the selections generally always change 
between major stripping versions, and variables can look very different between 
reconstruction versions.</p>
<p>The list of stripping selection largely defines the reconstructed decays that 
are available to you, but the list is very long as there&apos;s a lot we can do with 
our data. If you don&apos;t know the stripping line you need, it&apos;s usually best to 
ask the stripping coordinators of the working group you&apos;ll be presenting your 
work to. To learn more about the stripping, the best resource is the <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCb/LHCbStripping" target="_blank">stripping 
page on the LHCb
TWiki</a>.
In it we can find:</p>
<ul>
<li>The status of the current stripping, e.g. for <a href="http://lhcbproject.web.cern.ch/lhcbproject/Reprocessing/stats-re-stripping28.html" target="_blank">Stripping 
<code>S28</code></a>.</li>
<li>The configuration of all past stripping campaign, e.g. for <a href="http://lhcbproject.web.cern.ch/lhcbproject/Reprocessing/stats-re-stripping-fall14.html" target="_blank">Stripping 
<code>S21r1</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the information on all strippings can be found in the <a href="http://lhcb-release-area.web.cern.ch/LHCb-release-area/DOC/stripping/" target="_blank">stripping 
project 
website</a>, 
where you can see all the algorithms run and cuts applied in each <em>line</em>.
For example, if we wanted to understand the 
<code>D2hhPromptDst2D2KKLine</code> line, which we will use in the 
<a href="interactive-dst.html">exploring a DST</a> lesson later on, we would go 
<a href="http://lhcb-release-area.web.cern.ch/LHCb-release-area/DOC/stripping/config/stripping28/charm/strippingd2hhpromptdst2d2kkline.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
