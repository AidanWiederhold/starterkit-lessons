These lessons are not really about software, they are about people. If
you have followed along until this point you are more than qualified
to edit the lessons. There are probably several mistakes in these
lessons, or they will be outdated soon. Keeping them working and
fixing all mistakes is a monumental task for one single person.

meaning.
