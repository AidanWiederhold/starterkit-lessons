## Topics

1.  General introduction to DaVinci
1.  [Using screen to keep things running](01-screen.html)
2.  Find the dataset in the Bookkeeping
2.  Download a file from the grid
2.  Interactive look inside a DST with python
3.  Finding your stripping line
2.  Minimal DaVinci running locally
3.  Storing large files on EOS
4.  Minimal DaVinci on the grid
5.  Add a simple TupleTool to the job
6.  LoKi Hybrid tool
7.  Fun with LoKi functors
8.  Switch to a new stripping (20 -> 21) for one line in MC
9.  Split your jobs into subjobs
6.  open the resulting nTuple in ROOT and make mass peak

This is a rough list of the areas we would like to cover:

* Setting up your development environment
* Working with the repository
* First DecayTreeTuple on the grid (including screen, EOS storage, ...)
* Fun with LoKi functors
* (re/ab)using a stripping line
* Swapping mass hypotheses
* Decay tree fitter
* TIS, TOS and HLT
* Applying multivariate tools in DecayTreeTuple

Each area needs to be broken down into chunks of 10-15minute topics.
