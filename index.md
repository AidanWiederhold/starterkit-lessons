## Topics

1.  Outline
1.  General introduction to DaVinci
1.  [Using screen to keep things running](02-screen.html)
2.  Find the dataset in the Bookkeeping
2.  Download a file from the grid
2.  Interactive look inside a DST with python
3.  General introduction to Stripping
3.  Finding your stripping line
2.  Minimal DaVinci running locally
3.  Storing large files on EOS
4.  Minimal DaVinci on the grid
5.  Add a simple TupleTool to the job
6.  LoKi Hybrid tool
7.  Fun with LoKi functors
8.  Switch to a new stripping (20 -> 21) for one line in MC
9.  Split your jobs into subjobs
10. (Stripping line efficiency)
11. How to abuse a stripping line (replace mass hypo)
12. TisTos and what it all means
13. TupleTools for TISTOS'ing
14. (Caveats for TISTOS'ing)
15. What is DecayTreeFitter
16. How do I use DecayTreeFitter
17. Minimal DV with mass constraint
6.  open the resulting nTuple in ROOT and make mass peak

This is a rough list of the areas we would like to cover:

* Setting up your development environment
* Working with the repository
* First DecayTreeTuple on the grid (including screen, EOS storage, ...)
* Fun with LoKi functors
* (re/ab)using a stripping line
* Swapping mass hypotheses
* Decay tree fitter
* TIS, TOS and HLT
* Applying multivariate tools in DecayTreeTuple

Each area needs to be broken down into chunks of 10-15minute topics.
