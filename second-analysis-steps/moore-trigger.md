Moore is a set of Python files used to configure Gaudi applications. These files are then passed to `gaudirun.py` which can use them for example to configure a trigger selection.

This is one of the few pieces of LHCb software which is incredibly well [documented](https://lhcbdoc.web.cern.ch/lhcbdoc/moore/master/index.html) and the lesson taught in the ImpactKit follows a [tutorial](https://lhcbdoc.web.cern.ch/lhcbdoc/moore/master/tutorials/hlt2_line.html) given in the Moore gitbook.
